<small>THE ETHOS OF THE SPY</small></h2>


<p>The worldly philosophy of the current age bears
the name of Pragmatism, the principles of which,
so far as they are susceptible of being weighed,
constitute a more or less modified view of the
doctrine that the end justifies the means, a teaching
which has become familiar to us through the
pages of Nietzsche and Stendhal, and which is
based mainly on the idea that might is the proper
measure of right. Taking it, then, that pragmatical
notions of this sort have become almost
an implicit condition of individual progress, it
would seem to serve little purpose seriously to
go into the question of the wrongfulness or the
rightfulness of spying as a factor in the struggle
for complete self-expression—itself the real aim
of all ordered and prearranged lives. It is
sufficient for us to reflect that the successful spy
flourishes to-day, as he has flourished since the
beginnings of recorded time, and as in all probability
he will continue to flourish till the day of
doom. Indeed, it is not an unreasonable presumption
that in the very earliest ages of the
world, espionage must have been an entirely
necessary condition of the struggle for existence
among the infra-men who then peopled the caves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>of the earth and who succeeded in successfully
surviving only by virtue of predatory acts and
excursions in which the spoils and the plunder
went to the strongest, who had also made themselves
the best-informed as to sources of supply.
Bible history, too, has told us about the Spy.
The story of Joshua, the leader of Israel's hosts
and the excellent organisation of informers which
he controlled, remain like other tales of common
human interest in the Scriptures among those that
linger always in the minds of the least Biblical
of students. Babylon, we are told, was overrun
with informers of all kinds, Memphis and Thebes
in their turn became what Alexandria proved to
be in the time of Tiberius, and what the great
capitals of our own day have become—namely,
recruiting centres for criminal adventurers of all
types, nationalities and classes, and consequently
happy hunting-grounds for all in rapid quest of
the agents of intrigue, iniquity and maleficence.
Those, too, who have read the classical writers
will remember that great leaders like Alexander,
Mithridates, Scipio, Hannibal, Pompey and Cæsar,
laid the foundations of successful campaigns and
political achievement upon information previously
supplied them by commissioned spies.</p>

<p>According to the Roman idea, spying was
accounted a fair stratagem in both war and politics
and was, in theory at least, distinguishable from
treachery. Between the two acts there is, of
course, a real difference, although in works dealing
with international law the terms are often confused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>some writers treating them as interchangeable,
whilst others but loosely differentiate between
the act of spying and that of betrayal, the
presumption always remaining that the man who
is capable of being a successful and voluntary spy
also possesses talents which are common to the
elemental traitor. The penalty of death, says
Bluntschli, should be such as to terrify all spies,
and it is the custom accordingly to execute them
ignominiously by hanging. Technically the spy
has been defined as one who clandestinely goes
in quest of information, whilst a traitor is one
who spies within his own community and to its
undoing. Although most authorities agree in
considering espionage as lawful among the ruses of
warfare, all, with one exception, concur in determining
that death remains the only logical desert
of the man who has possessed himself of secrets
upon which the common safety depends. Certain
international jurists have objected to the employment,
in any cause, of spies, as being immoral,
or as condoning acts which are of themselves
immoral, and the French writer Morin looks upon
espionage with particular horror on the ground
that it is "usually malice aforethought and is
never voluntary," a peculiar enough view. It is
especially blameable, he holds, because a premium
is placed upon essentially dishonest dealing,
although he admits, with some inconsistency, that
it may sometimes become lawful—when it is
unsoiled by perfidy, as he puts it. Only the last
emergency can at all justify it, says Morin, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>is singular in declaring that a spy should not be
put to death unless caught in the act. Napoleon
himself displayed an unexpected leniency wherever
possible towards captured spies, and this
on the ground, as he said, that the spy is, by his
nature, a base character. In the opinion of the
great soldier the best spy is the half-breed who is
a natural cosmopolitan and is consequently unaffected
by ideas of patriotism. His greatest spy,
Schulmeister, was a man of decidedly mongrel
antecedents and began life as a smuggler. Pedlars
he also declared to be invaluable in espionage, and
for the reason that they are naturally disposed
to vagabondage, itself a trait of degeneracy.
It is well known that he would only employ in
such work men whose past had been soiled by
some act of a disgraceful or criminal kind, and
like the great Frederick, it was his custom to
propose to actually convicted criminals their
enlargement as the reward of a successful piece
of spying.</p>

<p>Modern spies of the professional type, more
especially those employed by Germany, fully meet
the specifications of Napoleon's idea of the race.
The accomplished spy of to-day is invariably a
man of at least quasi-criminal proclivities, a being
entirely lacking in a moral sense, a degenerate
briefly; and indeed experts in the secret history of
the German special-information departments all
agree in declaring that a "white man," to use an
Americanism, is worse than useless to the experts
at the chief bureau of the Berlin Secret Service.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>As a consequence, their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'élite</i> is mostly made
up of men who, if they have not known the inside
of prisons, have at least earned an unequivocal
right to such knowledge. One of the profoundest
technicians in the business of organising spy
campaigns, the late Karl Stieber, has stated that
the most valuable spy is your born aristocrat with
a bad record and a worse reputation. Proof of
the soundness of this view would seem to have
been fully advanced by the noble interveners in
the Dreyfus case, and, in any event, it is known
that among the names of the organising staff of
Berlin's school for spies, a large number are those
who bear the names of famous families, while the
remainder, if not all gentlemen by birth, are at
least gentlemen by act of parliament, as the
saying is. Courage, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aplomb</i>, the possession of
what Americans so aptly term "a good front,"
easy manners and a genial temperament—of any
or all of these qualifications, a man of good birth
is only in rare cases devoid. Heredity alone
has given him many of the psychic requirements
that go to make up the most valuable of actors
in a desperate situation, including, perhaps, that
philosophy of absolute <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</i> which makes
of him the most sinister and cold-blooded of all
criminal agents.</p>

<p>It would be unfair, however, to accuse the
Germans of monopolising all those vicious characteristics
which go to form the complete spy.
Indeed, it would probably be nearer the mark to
declare that it is only because of the elaborate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>excellence of the German organisation that the
Teuton has signalised himself so prominently
these later times in espionage. For, in truth,
the Teutonic mind is fundamentally lacking, it is
well known, in those qualities of craft and imagination
which produce the best kind of secret service
agent. Perseverance and the philosophy which
knows how to wait on circumstances, these
conventional enough qualities he undoubtedly
possesses in a marked degree above his fellows.
Nevertheless, they are not the most important
requirements of the master-spy, whose base
diplomacy and its results must depend to a great
extent upon the exercise of constructive imagination
and the forcing of circumstances to suit his
particular strategy. The German has excelled
his congeners at the business in the opinion of
modern men solely for the reason that among the
Germans the trade of the spy is not accounted
more dishonourable than any other. In all probability,
however, the Italian, the Greek, the Kelt,
given a highly systematised school and an equal
ethical standpoint, would prove abler executants
in any mission which called for the employment
of deep-set guile, the power of divining motives
and the ability to calculate the effect of moves.
The essential arts of the diplomatist—has not an
ambassador been described as an official spy?—underlie,
in respect of the mental operations
required, the work of your successful secret service
agent, and although men like Bismarck, whose
mentality was not of a positively Teutonic cast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>may be cited in disproof of the statement, it is
certain that the German mind is less adapted
and less adaptable to the fine processes of the arts
of political negotiation than that of either the Kelt
or the Italian.</p>

<p>Women, it is interesting to learn, from high
authorities on the arts of espionage, are rarely
effective or satisfactory agents in secret service.
Not, it must be understood, that woman is incapable
of the requisite baseness that is, in the
successful spy, an indispensable quality. Far
from it. Goethe, who was a competent judge of
the sex, has placed on record his view that woman,
when intent on turpitude, is capable of sounding
lower depths than the vilest of the male species.
German experts are, however, unanimous in
eliminating to a minimum point the services of
women as spies, and that too on the ground that
they are rarely to be relied upon if once romantic
sentiment becomes engaged in their operations—an
ever-present possibility. "Any woman but a
German woman" was a common cry of Karl
Stieber who may be trusted to have well understood
the character of his fair compatriot, for
whom love and romance—the purer the better—constitute
the only things worth living for in this
drab enough world. Indeed, the famous Salic
Law is said to have owed its first enacting mainly
to the fact that German women were as a rule
found to be unreliable, shall we say? where their
intimate feelings were apt to become involved,
and those who have resided in Germany will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>require to be told that a handsome face and a
brave air, added to a romantic bent, go very much
further with women in the land of beer, love and
song than with their sisters in perhaps any other
country in the world. The work of the efficient
spy involves, it is clear, a peculiar but none
the less specific proportioning of analytical and
synthetical qualities of brain-work, and while the
feminine mind, which works mainly on its intuitions,
may be described as wholly of a synthetic
calibre, it has, except in the rarest cases, of
analytical faculties—the ability for properly
appraising and forecasting causes and effects—the
very poorest provision.</p>

<p>The elaborate calculations of your Schulmeisters
and Stiebers may be said, in nearly all cases, to
have worked out with the smoothness of algebraic
equations, and it is extremely rare that women
display either the self-restraint or the reasoning
power which carry to successful solution dragging
intrigues with anything like the patient routine
and regularity which a series of really unromantic
situations calls for. Obviously, the work of the
spy, no matter how dramatic it may appear in its
co-ordinated whole, must, in respect of its various
separate acts and phases, be bared of all dramatic
or arresting incident. Were the opposite the
case, woman, a natural actor, would find herself
in the most congenial of elements. Anything
more sordid, however, or more commonplace than
the general phase-work of the spy, it would be
difficult to imagine, and it is precisely for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>reason that woman as a rule fails as a secret service
agent. In matters of love or revenge, where her
deepest feelings are concerned, she is capable of
a sustained effort calling for the application of
whatever analytical powers she may possess, but
seldom in other cases; for an appeal to, say, her
patriotism leaves her almost invariably cold and
unenthusiastic, since love of country is a quality
which depends too largely on an essentially
platonic and impersonal principle to attract and
hold for long her undivided interest and attention.</p>

<p>On the whole, a study of the spy, however interesting
it may prove in respect of the undoubted
variety of its actors and dramatic aspects, must
be held to be a criminological study. Even in the
cases of Hale and André, whose careers owe much
of the halo which invests them to their tragic fate,
one is suspicious of fanaticism in the former and
pronounced megalomania in the latter, both
symptoms of unsoundness of mind. However
much the spy may plead disinterestedness in the
pecuniary sense, or point to present poverty as a
token of his claim to have worked for an implicit
moral principle, one is conscious in studying the
life of any one of the species in more modern times,
that he contained within him all the necessary
elements which go to make up the character and
personality of that class of degenerate who is
prepared to travel any path provided he be given
the means to play a more or less spectacular rôle.
He is invariably to be found among that type of
men who advance the peculiar claim that "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>world owes every wight a living," strangely forgetful
of the historic retort in point. The application
of this principle to all the length to which
it is capable of being extended would, of course,
justify the struggle for existence of the summer
burglar, the swell mobsman, the sand-bag artist
and the lead-pipe assassin, to mention but a few
members of the big brotherhood which lives by
crime. It is undoubtedly true that many successful
spies lay claim to be scions of splendid families,
and, as we have said, German authorities will not
employ men on important missions in espionage
who have not at least had the education of gentlemen.
The boastful claim of pedigree—obviously
untenable in the majority of cases—provides for
the writer, at any rate, something of a key to
the psychology of the spy. Pride of mythical
ancestry is undoubtedly a capital symptom of
megalomania, among the conditions of which is
the obsession of self-importance, and this would
seem to be a widely prevalent disease among the
sons of men. The desire to be near important
people, to be engaged in no matter how lowly a
capacity with men who direct important affairs,
to associate in more or less familiar fashion with
celebrities, or people highly placed, to count for
even an infinitesimal part in the conduct of big
events, to have the tips of one's fingers in the
particular pie of the moment, to have been "not
altogether out of it," as the cant phrase goes, in
any given episode, but above all to be known to
integral outsiders as having played the rôle of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>fractional insider in any cause—this is an acute
mania with a larger part of the human race than
is commonly suspected. Megalomania of this
kind goes a far way to explain the reason why
men fitted for success in the unspectacular and
prosaic careers of life will deliberately devote
themselves to what must ever be considered as
among the most disreputable of trades.</p>

<p>It may be objected that at least it is a business
which requires courage and that all successful
exponents of the metier of spying have been
men of undoubted courage. While admitting the
boldness of men like Le Caron and Schulmeister,
it may be said that they displayed audacity rather
than courage, and the two qualities spring from
entirely distinct motives. Often the audacity
which passes for courage arises either from a lack
of imagination, or else from a blind fatalism, and
in neither case is there any display of real courage.
Duty, presumably, is the fundamental motive of
courage, and until your spy can be shown to have
engaged in the perilous business of espionage out
of purely conscientious devotion to task and
principle—Le Caron, it is only right to say, claims
all of this—he must be classed with that type of
individual who enters into the business of unrighteousness
"for all there is in it," to use an
American phrase, and well knowing the tolls and
penalties which failure will inevitably exact. It
is impossible, in perusing the private correspondence
of the loud and boastful Stieber, not to divine
the presence of a spirit of active maleficence, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>measure of whose humanity is to be found in
the number of cold-blooded executions for which
he was responsible in his capacity as an agent of
Bismarck's lust for conquest. And Stieber's congeners
were as a rule no worse and no better than
himself, the only difference being that the German
held a larger stage on which to enact his rôle
and had correspondingly greater opportunities.
The most charitable argument that one can employ
to excuse the existence of the spy is that by which
Napoleon sought to explain his leniency towards
them: They are a species of humanity which is
by nature base, and to that extent only are not
responsible for their characteristics.</p>

<h2><abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />

<small>THE SPY THROUGH THE AGES</small></h2>


<p>The spy, as we have seen, has been given mention
in the Old Testament, Joshua, David and Absalom
having employed their services, and most of us
remember that passage in Genesis in which his
brothers answer Joseph saying: "We are true
men, thy servants are not spies." The protracted
peregrinations of the Israelites necessarily
called for the employment of emissaries who
should learn the qualities and dispositions of the
many peoples whom they encountered on their
way to the Promised Land, and your anthropologist
might possibly not be far wrong in concluding
that it was the experience gained in the
course of his ever-perilous wanderings which made
the Jew so apt an exponent of the arts of spying
as he most certainly proved himself to be in the
days of consular and early imperial Rome. In
the New Testament, too, we hear of the spy when
the high priests, having Christ under suspicion,
sent forth spies who should feign friendship with
Him for the purposes of extracting information.
Every commander of antiquity was accustomed
to employ the services of spies, as the Greek
historian Polyænus tells us in the course of that
marvellous compilation of his in which he gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>details of some nine hundred stratagems, serviceable,
it is noteworthy, not only in war, but also
in civil and political life. If we are to judge by
what the Romans say of themselves, their character
was incapable of stooping to the baseness of
common spying or studied treachery of any sort.
The view is, of course, open to criticism, and when
we reflect upon the treatment which triumphing
generals were wont to accord to their most illustrious
captives, not easily acceptable. One of the
most formidable spirits of antiquity, Mithridates,
King of Pontus, a prince regarding whose exploits
writers have been strangely neglectful, was himself
the chief spy of his army, and for the purposes
of this work had made himself master, Pliny tells,
of some five and twenty languages and dialects, by
means of which, as well as fitting disguises, he was
enabled to penetrate every region of Asia Minor.
It is written that from the time of his succession
to the throne of Pontus at the age of fourteen, he
spent seven years wandering through and spying
out the countries which he eventually conquered,
and for the possession of which he waged a lifelong
war against the power of Rome.</p>

<p>In the course of a work entitled <cite>Stratagems</cite>,
Frontinus, a military writer in the time of Vespasian,
records how Cornelius Lelius, having been
sent by Scipio Africanus in the capacity of envoy
to Syphax, King of Numidia, but in reality for
the purposes of espionage, took with him several
officers of high rank in the Roman army, all disguised.
A general in the camp of Syphax, recognising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>one of these companions, Manlius, as having
studied with him at Corinth, and well knowing
him to be an officer in the Roman army, began
to put awkward questions. Thereupon Lelius fell
upon Manlius and thrashed him, declaring the
fellow to be a pushful valet and nothing better.
On the same occasion, the envoy allowed a high-spirited
and richly caparisoned horse to escape
from his suite in order to be given the opportunity
of going through the camp to recover it. Again
there was Tarquin the Proud who, failing to
capture the city of Gabii to which he was laying
siege, had his son flogged till the blood ran from
his body and then sent him a refugee into the
midst of the enemy, with instructions to procure
by bribery the surrender of the place, all of which
the youth accomplished. Polyænus tells how
Sertorius, the Roman general in Spain, was
the owner of a white fawn that he had trained
to follow him everywhere, even to the steps of the
tribunal which the animal had been taught, at a
given signal, to approach as Sertorius was about
to deliver sentence in judicial cases. The commander
allowed it to be made known that he
derived much information from this fawn. Meanwhile
his spies were very active all over the country
and the tribes all marvelled at the knowledge of
the general, who attributed it to the little beast
for which he claimed supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Polyænus also teaches the necessity of "psychologising"—a
term not unknown to American
experts in that form of police torture which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>known as the Third Degree—the leader to whom
one may be opposed. "One must exert oneself,"
says the Greek, "to find out the character of
one's enemy as well as his disposition; whether he
is impetuous and spirited at the first shock, or
patient and apt to await the onslaught." Every
general should know all there is to be known about
the business of opponents, and he goes on to tell
the tale in point, showing that what we know
to-day as the Black Cabinet—that is, the spying
of private correspondence in the post—was
practised by Alexander the Great who lived some
three hundred years before Christ. "Being in
Carmania, he was informed that the Macedonians
and Greeks in his army were speaking badly about
him. Alexander thereupon assembled his friends
and told them that as he intended writing home
they should do likewise. Accordingly, they all
wrote home and Alexander saw to it that the
couriers were recalled with the mails before they
had gone very far on their journey." Recurring
to the same authority, we learn that cipher was
well known to the Greeks under the name <i>skutate</i>
and to the Romans as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutula</i>, meaning a wooden
cylinder around which an inscribed papyrus was
rolled. He also records the story of Histiæus, a
tyrant of Miletus who wished to incite Ionia to
rebel against Darius; fearing however to send
letters to the Ionians in those perilous times,
he thought out the ruse of having the head of a
trusted slave clean shaved and a message written
on the scalp, addressed to Aristagoras in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>simple words: "Rouse Ionia to revolt." The
slave was then sent on his way to Ionia, and, his
hair having grown over the fateful message by
the time hostile camps were reached, he passed
safely through to Aristagoras, who had the poll
shaved once more and so learned his general's
design. Altogether it would seem that during
antiquity, ruse rather than real ability was the
cause of many loud-famed successes and victories.
Frontinus tells how the Consul Hirtius used to
send carrier-pigeons to his friend Decimus Brutus,
and Justus Lipsius is responsible for the statement
that swallows were trained for purposes of military
and other espionage, the same authority informing
us that it was the custom among Eastern
nations for birds to be trained as long-distance
messengers, more especially between lovers. It
may be certain, too, that postal communications
were not all entrusted to the famous relay runners,
regarding whose marvellous stamina the Roman
records tell us.</p>

<p>Hannibal, it is certain, could never have performed
that wondrous march from the edge of
Andalusia right up through Spain, over the
Pyrenees, across France and beyond the Alps into
the plains of Piedmont, where he fought his most
artistic battle in 218 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, at the Trebia, had it not
been for an organisation of spies and informers
who prepared the way by ruse and diplomacy
for the advance of his hordes. Of him Polybius
writes: "For years before he undertook his
campaign against Rome, he had sent his agents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>into Italy and they were observing everyone and
everything. He charged them with transmitting
to him exact and positive information regarding
the fertility of the trans-Alpine plains and the
valley of the Po, their populations, their military
spirit and preparations and, above all, their
disposition towards the government at Rome.
There was nothing too large in promises that
the Carthaginian was not ready to make in return
for their support against the hated City." Cæsar
too employed spies to the undoing of his adversaries
in Egypt, in Gaul and also in Britain, and
although in his Commentaries he records his
employment of emissaries of this kind, history remains
generally blank as to special details, leaving
us to conclude that, like Napoleon, he relied mainly
on the exigencies of the moment to produce the
required information through the bribery of
individuals in the opposite camp. In his early
political career, especially during his tenure of the
office of Pontifex Maximus, it seems clear that he
then laid the leading lines, through the employment
of many informers, of that vast political
network of which he subsequently became the
master, while his later association with Marcus
Crassus, who mainly owed both wealth and power
to the army of spies which he controlled, was in
every way to Cæsar's advantage in respect of the
means of procuring important information. Had
he employed the services of a spy system on his
attainment to supreme power, it is unlikely that
he would have come to his destruction at the hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>of a group of the best-known men in Rome, the
fact leaving us to infer that he had ceased to use
a secret service after the Civil War.</p>

<p>On the passing of Constantine to the Bosporus
in the fourth century, Rome, in the process
of the ages, became the centre of a vast ecclesiastical
power. The work of the spy then reached
the honours of a kind of consecration. Writers
like Lachesnaie and Deville emphasise the view
that ecclesiastics are especially fitted for the
business of spying. Fouché and Talleyrand had
been clerics in their early days and certainly both
were masters in the business of organising special-information
corps. In his works, too, the Prussian
General, Karl von Decker, declares that "a secret
which cannot be penetrated by a woman or a
priest will never be penetrated." To tell the
story of Church espionage would exhaust the
capacity of a large library, and in this connection
it may be said that adversaries of the Church of
Rome have ever held that the Confessional was a
purely political invention, the object of which
was to spy upon the community. Whether this
be so or not, it is fortunately not our business to
decide; it is fair, however, to mention the prevalence
of the view. In any case, clerics have
ever proved themselves apt for the work of espionage,
and in a collection of ordinances issued and
signed by Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> in 1652, a certain Father
Berthoud, "although an ecclesiastic, is authorised
to disguise himself in any way he likes in Paris,
Bordeaux, Blaye and elsewhere," for the purposes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>of spy work among the political and social
enemies of the Crown. Cardinal Richelieu and
his understudy, Père Joseph, practically inaugurated
in France the system of opening private
communications, a practice which was carried to
its extreme under Napoleon, of whose daily budget
of private letters, his fourth secretary, Fain, has
told us much.</p>

<p>That the system of espionage persists to our own
day in Continental colleges and convents under
the control of congregational clerics, is a fact which
is well known. Each division of a school is invariably
placed under the chronic vigilance of a
"surveillant," or watcher, who in his turn employs
his own corps of spies, privileged boys moving
among the masses of their congeners, marking
their intentions, noting the relations of the
younger boys with the older, getting information
as to unlawful programmes to be carried out,
ferreting out secret testimony as to the habits of
suspect characters and, if possible, intercepting
amorous billets which pass between elder boys
in other divisions and the younger fry. In regard
to these unwholesome <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaisons</i> the vigilance
of the spies is certainly justified; but the system
goes much deeper than this in foreign schools, its
objects being to inquire into the most intimate
details regarding the private character of a boy—heaven
only knows why, if it is not for the pure
love of finding out. Indeed, it must be allowed
that the baser tendencies which are to be noted in
the case of all spies, here display themselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the form of a pruriency which often touches the
indecent and always the unwholesome.</p>

<p>The real founder of the business of organised
spying in modern times was Frederick the Great,
who was wont to boast that his spies exceeded
his cooks in the proportion of a hundred to one.
It is impossible closely to read the story of
Frederick, or even to study minutely his face as
pictured, say, by Meyn, without becoming conscious
of the fact that here was a being who
realised in his personality the claim of the psychologists
that great ability and criminal tendencies
are often closely affiliated. Apart from what we
know of his perverse eccentricities, it is certain
that his deliberate elimination of all the higher
ideals of humanity from a place in his political
philosophy had the effect of making him as impersonal
as an automaton where his material
ambitions were concerned, and he knew no other.
Like the true pragmatist he was, Frederick considered
all things good in themselves which served
his ends, and his policies were invariably conceived
on his pet principle: "If honesty fails us, we
have always dishonesty to fall back upon." He
it was who laid the foundations of that policy of
Prussianisation of which our story of Stieber tells
in its turn, and in which no measure was to be
considered too extreme or base, nor turpitude
too abhorrent, provided it advanced the interests
of his House and furthered its ambition to play
in Europe that rôle which had passed to the
Habsburgs by inheritance from the Cæsars. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Prussia Frederick sought a permanent predominance
in Europe equal to all which Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV.</abbr>
had exercised between 1661 and 1715. An understanding
of these facts is really the condition of
grasping the significance of the elaborate Prussian
spy system of our own time.</p>

<p>Lastly comes the age of Napoleon, in which we
find that, for all the essential militarism of the
imperial regime, the spy really played a more
prominent rôle in the social and political drama
than in that of the camp, the great soldier, except
in extraordinary cases of long-laid plans, as in the
Austerlitz campaign, relying mainly on human
cupidity touched by the magic of his gold, to find,
as the occasion demanded, willing perverts to
provide him with the information necessary to
the success of his combinations.</p>

<small>LE CARON</small></h2>


<p>Away back in the later eighties, when Ireland
was in the throes of her penultimate fight for the
principle of self-government, all true sons of Erin
had marked out for their particular obloquy two
individuals who have since become notorious—namely,
Piggott, the forger, and Major Le Caron,
the spy. Those whose memories travel back easily
to the famous <i>Times</i> Commission will recollect
how offensively both names stunk in the nostrils
of all who supported the late Irish leader. Among
Nationalists, it will be remembered, the spy was
invariably spoken of under the name "Le Carrion,"
and even those who gave him the benefit of a
proper pronunciation of his pseudonym were
wont to utter it with that peculiarly hissing
emphasis with which Irishmen, among all men,
seem able to invest the names of those who run
counter to their political bias. The positive
venom which certain eloquent Nationalists seem
actually to instil into the pronunciation of names
like "Dublin Castle," "Major Trant," "Lord
Clanricarde" lingers long afterwards in the
memory of English listeners, just as the rattle of
certain snakes is said ever afterwards to linger in
the ears of those who have escaped them in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>jungle. To hear the late Mr Biggar, for instance,
utter the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de guerre</i> of the famous British spy
was a real lesson in the onomatopœic art, and on
his lips the name, otherwise inoffensive and, indeed,
on English tongues a liquid enough quantity,
was made to attain a sibilancy which was truly
weird in its effect.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center smcap">Henri Le Caron</p>

<p class="center"><i>By permission of Mr. William Heinemann</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>How came the Major by his adopted name, and
was it really meant to portend anything? It was
humorously said at the time that the spy had taken
his pseudonym from the French form of the name
of that mythical boatman of classic memory who
was wont for a few halfpence to ferry the souls of
the damned across the river Styx, Charon, to wit.
Le Caron is, however, a common enough French
name, and the Major had lived some years in
France previously to migrating to the United
States, in which country Thomas Beach first
became Henri Le Caron. Born at Colchester,
Essex, in 1841, Beach belonged to a type of
family which was clearly of old-fashioned puritanical
stock, and the point is important enough
in view of his later claim to have acted the rôle
of traitor purely on the ground of moral principle.
In his autobiography he tells how from his earliest
days he had been brought up to cherish the Bible
and to loathe all forms and quantities of alcoholic
liquor. His home life was altogether not a very
bright one and dull domestic repression soon began
to exert its own particular reaction on a character
which was already bursting with the spirit of
adventure and derring-do. He records it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>the routine of his existence grew too monotonous
for the larger soul within him, and how he ran
away from home and a Quaker's shop at least
three times before his sixteenth year, breaking
his apprentice bonds and travelling far and wide,
yet managing, at whatever town he made a halt,
to earn what he calls a respectable living. Like
most characters of his obviously crude and untutored
kind, in whom the spirit of romance is
a considerable, if a somewhat jumbled, equation,
there was not a little of the megalomaniac in the
boy, and even in those early days his soul thirsted
after the big things of life. In young Beach, too,
there was a bit of artistry of sorts, and just as it
was a chief ambition of Spy Schulmeister to dance
like a marquis of the old regime, and a foible of
Spy Stieber to accumulate pectoral decorations
testifying to his honour, so also the youthful Le
Caron discovered a precocious passion for hymns
and the music of the church organ. At Colchester
he became a leading and decorous choir lad, and
according to himself it was his love for psalmody
rather than any regard for his puritanical parents
which invariably brought about his return,
prodigal-wise, to the paternal roof. One is
obliged in that spirit of fairness which gives the
devil all that is due to him, to insist on what are
otherwise prosaic enough details, and all the more
so because, to the man's admirers, his piety provides
an argument for the rôle he afterwards
adopted in life.</p>

<p>Having spent some years in Paris, where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>worked as an agent for that now-extinct old
worthy, John Arthur, earning a living which
enabled him to present a highly respectable
figure, he clearly felt a call, he tells us, to join
the North in 1861, when the kindling American
Civil War made the States a kind of promised
land for all sorts of adventurous spirits, most of
whom, it may be supposed, were still feeling the
influences of the comparatively fresh Napoleonic
legend. Taking out a passport in the name of
Henri Le Caron, young Beach shipped on the
<i>Great Eastern</i>, then about to take her maiden trip
across the Atlantic, and landed duly in New York,
where the military authorities enlisted him as a
private in the Pennsylvania Reserves. Le Caron—he
was never after 1861 known by the name
of Beach—passes over his military career with
unexpected haste in his autobiography, it must
be said. He was present, he tells, at important
engagements during the course of the war, first
as an infantry soldier, subsequently as a cavalryman,
receiving promotion and being especially
detailed for scouting operations. In 1864 he was
gazetted second lieutenant and by 1865 had
attained the rank of regimental adjutant with
the title of Major—a rank which became, it may
be said in passing, at the close of the war, so
common throughout the States, that humorists
were wont to tell how in 1866 it was impossible
to throw a brick in any given direction where
men happened to assemble without hitting an
officer of that standing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>Le Caron, it is interesting to note, records his
act of religious faith in the following words:—"We
are impelled by some unknown force to
carry out, not of our own volition or possible
design, the work of this life, indicated by a combination
of circumstances to which unconsciously
we adapt ourselves." This, it may be remembered,
was the religion of the late Prince Bismarck,
and it must be allowed that it is a highly convenient
and elastic hypothesis of life. It goes
far to explain how he came to be associated with
Fenianism. Le Caron declares, however, that
he was far from having gone in search of the
Fenians; on the contrary, he insists, the Fenians
came in search of Le Caron. The Major disappoints
us rather badly, nevertheless, by failing
to show how it was that the Irish in America, even
in those days a powerful community, should have
sought out the psalmodical soldier who abhorred
alcohol in all its forms and possible quantities,
and why he, a Briton, of all men, should have
been singled out to put life into the Irish-American
movement for the emancipation of the Sister Isle.
At the head of that movement in 1865 was James
Stephens, who directed the organisation both in
Ireland and America, while his agents on American
soil included some of the shrewdest Irishmen of
that age and, indeed, some of the most prosperous.
Le Caron explains briefly how he first entered the
movement as a spy. A fellow-officer had informed
him quite casually that the main object of the
Irish-American agitation of that date was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>invasion of Canada. This startling bit of news
proved more than sufficient to call out the fires
of the old puritanical moralist dormant in the
Major, who proceeds to inform us in the language
of tragic passion which one applies to a tailor
who has omitted a minor detail, that he "felt
quite indignant at learning what was being done
against the interests of my native country."
Accordingly, and in order to unload his chest of
the perilous secret, he addressed a letter to his
father, a local tradesman, at Colchester, informing
the sire that an attack was contemplated on the
Dominion by a group of bold bad Irishmen.
Evidently there was in the Beach tribe a congenital
incapacity for holding a secret, for no
sooner had the old man read his son's letter than,
"startled and dismayed at the tidings it conveyed,
he, true Briton that he was," made over the
letter to the then sitting member for Colchester,
a Mr Rebow. It was this gentleman who was
instrumental in procuring Le Caron his salaried
commission to act in America as a spy for the
British police authorities.</p>

<p>In 1867, Major Le Caron, freed from military
service, was looking around him for the means of
maintaining his family, and in the course of a visit
to England, was instructed by the British Government
to ally himself with the Fenian organisation
in America, "in order," as he frankly admits,
"to play the rôle of spy in the rebel ranks." His
adventurous nature welcomed the work as congenial,
he says, while his British instincts made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>him a willing worker from a sense of right.
Accordingly, on his return to America, he offered
his services as a military man to General O'Neill,
who was to lead the anti-British forces in the event
of another uprising. On his cordial acceptance
by O'Neill, as well as initiation, on his solemn oath,
into the Fenian Brotherhood under that soldier's
sponsorship, Le Caron returned to his Western
home and lost no time "in commencing to lead
my double life," as he puts it. At Lockport,
Illinois, he set about the organisation of a Fenian
"circle" in which he took the position officially
known by the title of "center," or commander,
a post which entitled him to receive all official
reports and communications issued by O'Neill.
These reports were duly transmitted to London
by the Major and one pauses here to reflect that
in this supplementary office Le Caron might not
inappropriately have borne the subsidiary title
of "scenter." The soul of the Major was clearly
one of no ordinary beauty and versatility, for in
order to supplement his gains as a secret-service
agent, he accepted about this time a comfortable
post as hospital steward in a vast gaol in Illinois.
Here, he naïvely admits, he felt at home, because,
as he writes, "in such a vast assembly of criminals,
there were many whose characters and careers
formed subjects for very interesting study to me.
I was fortunate in being connected with the prison
at a time when some more than usually clever and
facile scoundrels were temporarily resident there."
O'Neill was, however, on the look-out for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>energetic agents, and Le Caron was not suffered
to remain long in the comparatively inactive life
of an Illinois gaol. In response to a telegram
from headquarters, he proceeded hurriedly—and
apparently without giving due notice to his
employers—to New York, where he was engaged
as "major and military organiser of the Irish
Republican Army," at a salary equivalent to
£650 a year, a rare exchange for the few pounds
he was being paid weekly as a prison official
in Illinois. With his commission he received
instructions to proceed on an organising tour, in
the course of which, the Major learned, to his deep
disgust, that he was expected to address public
meetings as a sworn advocate of the Irish cause.
He knew nothing whatever about Irish politics
and was well aware that ignorance of Irish aspirations
meant, in the opinion of most Irishmen,
wholesale indifference, which was hardly worse
than active hostility itself. Once, indeed, he
found himself in a tight fix which called for all
the undoubted nerve the spy possessed. The
occasion was a Convention of the Fenian Brotherhood
at Williamsburg. The Major tells the story
in the course of his autobiography in the following
words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The evening came and with it our trip to
Williamsburg. On arrival there in the company
of O'Neill and some brother officers, I found
several thousands of persons assembled. We were
greeted with the greatest enthusiasm and given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>the seats of honour to the right and left of the
chairman. My position was a very unhappy one.
I was in a state of excessive excitement, for I
feared greatly what was coming. Seated as I was
next to O'Neill, I could hear him tell the chairman
on whom to call and how to describe the speakers;
and as each pause took place between the speeches,
I hung with nervous dread on O'Neill's words,
fearing my name would be next. The meeting
proceeded apace, some four or five of my companions
had already spoken and I was beginning
to think that after all the evil was postponed and
that for this night at least I was safe. Not so,
however. All but O'Neill and myself had spoken
when to my painful surprise I heard the General
call upon the chairman to announce Major Le
Caron. The moment was fraught with danger;
my pulses throbbed with a maddening sensation;
my heart seemed to stop its beating; my brain
was on fire and failure stared me in the face.
With an almost superhuman effort, I collected
myself, and as the chairman announced me as
Major M'Caron, tickled by the error into which he
had fallen and the vast cheat I was playing on
the whole of them, I rose equal to the occasion,
to be received with the most enthusiastic of
plaudits.</p>

<p>"The hour was very late and I took advantage
of the circumstance. Proud and happy as I was
at being with them that evening, and taking part
in such a magnificent demonstration, they could
not, I said, expect me to detain them long at so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>advanced an hour. All had been said upon the
subject nearest and dearest to their hearts.
(Applause.) If what I had experienced that night
was indicative of the spirit of patriotism of the
Irish in America (tremendous cheering), then
indeed there could be no fears for the result.
(Renewed plaudits.) And now I would sit down.
They were all impatiently waiting, I knew, to
hear the stirring words of the gallant hero of
Ridgeway, General O'Neill (thunders of applause),
and I would, in conclusion, simply beg of them as
lovers of liberty and motherland (excited cheering)
to place at the disposal of the General the cash
necessary to carry out the great work on which
he was engaged. This work, I was confident,
would result in the success of our holy cause and
the liberation of dear old Ireland from the thraldom
of the tyrant's rule which had blighted and
ruined her for seven hundred years. These last
words worked my hearers up to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm, and amidst their excited shouts
and cheers I resumed my seat, with the comforting
reflection that if it took so little as this to arouse
the Irish people, I could play my rôle with little
difficulty."</p></div>

<p>Fenian Conventions came and passed; the
organisation had grown to extraordinary proportions,
as is shown by the fact that in 1868,
when the Brotherhood made a demonstration
at Philadelphia, not fewer than 6000 armed
and uniformed Fenian soldiers paraded the city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>with General O'Neill at their head and Le Caron
among the staff. In the course of his work in
the Eastern States, the Major had already
distributed, he tells, 15,000 stands of arms
and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition for the
prospective raid which promised shortly to be
undertaken, on the prime condition, however,
that the funds should be forthcoming to finance
the adventure. In the spring of 1870 it was
decided to make the projected move upon Canada,
O'Neill declaring with a Kelt's enthusiasm that
"no power on earth could stop it." Le Caron,
who was, of course, already in active touch with
the Ottawa authorities, met the British agents at
Buffalo, giving them full particulars and details
as to the Raid which was about to take place.
On their departure to make complete preparations
for all eventualities, O'Neill arrived at
Buffalo, whence, and accompanied by Le Caron,
he left for the Front. "O'Neill," writes the
Major, "was full of enthusiasm and firmly believed
that the Canadians would be taken entirely
by surprise, while I myself was laughing at his
coming discomfiture." Arrived at the frontier,
O'Neill, who expected to find at least 1000
Fenians under arms—the nucleus of an army
which was to attract another 500,000 Irishmen
from all parts of America—discovered to his
dismay that only 250 men had assembled; this
number was swelled by the arrival of 250 more
on the morrow, when the General, fearful of the
effects of hesitation and delay, ordered his force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>to cross the border from Vermont into Canadian
territory. The simple Irishman addressed his
troops in early-Bonapartian fashion as follows:—
"Soldiers! This is the advance guard of the
Irish-American army for the liberation of Ireland
from the yoke of the oppressor. For your own
country's sake you enter that of the enemy.
The eyes of your countrymen are upon you.
Forward—March!"</p>

<p>The spy himself, from the crest of a slope,
watched the advance of the little band of invaders
as it crossed the border-line into British
territory, some in Fenian uniform of green and
gold, others in ordinary "Sunday" garb. Not
a soul was in sight, nor anything like a force to
oppose their progress. Le Caron well knew,
however, that behind the ridge towards which
the Fenian army advanced deployed, cheering
wildly and with bayonets fixed, at least 1000
Canadian volunteers were lying in wait. As the
invaders touched the slope, the Canadian rifles
opened fire, the Army of Liberation ceased forthwith
to exist, and the last the Major saw of General
O'Neill was that officer's passing in a hackney-coach
seated between the two policemen who
had arrested him. Le Caron of course fled with
the rest of the invaders, and immediately made
his way to Ottawa for the purpose, he says somewhat
unconvincingly, of personally "reporting"
to the authorities as to the raid, the result of
which had in all probability been telegraphed to
Government House ten minutes after the fiasco.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Duly he arrived at the political capital, where he
was, he says, received with the honours that
usually fall to the carriers of military dispatches.
Here a significant enough incident occurred.
Wishing to return home at once, Le Caron prepared
for the journey only to find at the last
moment that he was without funds for the
ticket; he thereupon applied to a certain
Judge, who wrote him a cheque for the unusually
generous sum of £70—generous seeing that the
sum was at least ten times the amount of his
fare supposing him still to have lived in the
West, while the fare from Ottawa to New York
State does not exceed fifteen dollars at the
farthest. With his usual dispatch in regard to
matters in which one's curiosity not unnaturally
looks for relief, Le Caron passes from the episode
without volunteering any explanation of a satisfactory
kind.</p>

<p>In the intervening time between the failure of
O'Neill's rising and the advent of the society of
United Irish Brothers, the Clan-na-gael, in 1873,
Le Caron spent his time studying medicine. As
a practitioner he claims to have had successes.
His taste for spying seems nevertheless to have
exceeded his love for medicine, for in 1873, with
the coming of the Clan, we find him laying his
plans to deal with that important body, which,
it may be said, differed from all other Irish-American
societies in the technical excellence of
its organisation. Its primary object was to unite
throughout America and the world all Irishmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>who loved their country. Naturally the Major,
although supposedly French, presented himself as
a candidate for membership in the new organisation,
and having improvised an Irish grandmother
to fortify his candidacy, was in due course admitted
to the Brotherhood on his sworn oath to
be loyal to its covenants. From the very first,
however, he became an object of suspicion to
several prominent leaders of the movement, and
it was only after a pressing fight for recognition
that he was eventually appointed to such a position
as should enable him to penetrate the
arcana of the society's inner shrines. As with
the Fenian body, he became in the Clan a member
of the Military Board. Every document of
value which afforded evidence of the Brotherhood's
dynamite propaganda directed against
English cities was, as in the F.B. days, transmitted
to the British Home Office, the correspondence
being actually carried on between Le Caron's
wife and another member of her sex in London.
Accordingly, one may readily believe the spy's
own statement that while he was a member of the
military councils of the Clan, he was also shaking
hands with danger and discovery at every turn
and only saved his skin by a miracle. In the
course of his association with the Brotherhood
Le Caron of course made the acquaintance of some
of the most prominent Irishmen in America's
anti-British movements of the past generation,
among them Messrs Egan, O'Donovan Rossa and
the late Patrick Ford. The last of this trio was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>never, he says, a member of the Clan nor any
other secret society, however much he may have
supported in his early days the physical-force
views which were advocated by extremists of all
kinds. Mr Ford owed his prominence, says the
Major, to the wide influence of his paper, <cite>The
Irish World</cite>, in the conduct of which was also
associated his brother, Mr Austin Brendan Ford,
as a business director. It was undoubtedly the
force which kept together the various elements of
the Irish community in the States; edited with
great ability, it had a vast circulation, which went
well into the hundreds of thousands and had its
readers among Irishmen in every quarter of the
globe. Mr Ford, though not a member of the
Brotherhood, allowed himself, says Le Caron, to
voice its policies through his paper.</p>

<p>Some idea of the influence of the Clan may be
formed when one realises that between 1876 and
1880, Russian revolutionary societies were treating
with the American organisation to carry out
any part of the propaganda in which a common
co-operation was possible. In return for Irish-American
financial aid, in the event of an Anglo-Russian
war, the Muscovite revolutionaries
pledged assistance to the Irish in the cause of
complete emancipation from the English bond.
Two extremely wealthy Irish-Americans were
prepared, it was understood, to support this
strange Russo-Irish alliance with many millions
of dollars. Included in a somewhat lengthy
programme were the three items, assassination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>of Queen Victoria, the kidnapping of the Prince
of Wales and the killing of the Tsar. All of these
intentions Le Caron ferreted out, conveying due
information to Scotland Yard. The late Mr
Parnell the Major also met in America, becoming
instrumental in "promoting" the Irish leader's
Land League ideas in the States. Of Parnell
Le Caron expressed the view that he was out
wholly and solely for what financial rewards
there were to be found in political agitation.
Davitt he regarded as a simple soul, but a born
conspirator and one who could not long be induced
to tread a constitutional path. It is clear
that Major Le Caron made the acquaintance of
all who were prominently engaged in the Parnell
movement, and it is a remarkable tribute to his
powers of deception that until he returned to
England for good and proved his real quality before
the Commission, not one of the actors in the last
phase of that memorable struggle ever suspected
him of being a secret-service man.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this story to follow the
Major throughout the whole of his career as a spy.
His work, which differed but little in regard to
its methods at any time or in any undertaking,
cannot at all be said to have been of a class which
required a very high type of mentality or any
diplomacy worthy of that description. For all
his prominence in the profession, it cannot be
said that Le Caron, at any point in his career, ever
rose above the status of a common informer.
He himself admits that he owed much of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>success to the fact that, finding himself among a
hard-drinking society, he was one of the rare men
who never allowed a taste for fire-water to endanger
the operation of his business. Nor can
we suppose that the Clan-na-gael men, whom he
deceived so long, were at all adept in the deeper
arts of political intrigue, or that they possessed
any of that finesse which marked the type of
men with whom Schulmeister had on nearly every
occasion to measure his nimble wits. Le Caron
claimed to be considered on a different level from
all other spies and for the reason that he adopted
the profession purely in the interests of his patriotism.
A close study of his confessions discloses,
however, a positive disposition towards the mercenary
aspect of things and the Major's art—in
literature, at least—is far too feeble to conceal the
fact. There is in many of his reflections upon
the parsimony of British secret-service paymasters
the suggestion of a whimper in regard to the
small pecuniary rewards he obtained for services
which he himself naturally appraised very
highly, but which really only provided results
which were certain to have been arrived at
even if the British Government had never employed
an official spy upon the Irish-American
brotherhoods.</p>

<p>Le Caron owed much of that quasi-heroic reputation
which grew up around him and his career to
the fact that he appeared on a drab enough stage
as the only figure with melodramatic possibilities
inherent in it at a time when the Americanised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>type of journalism was creeping into England
and when journalists were being gradually initiated
into the mysteries of writing up what is technically
known among newspaper men as the "human
interest" side of all persons and things. In
the personal cast of the Parnell Commission and
its long-drawn sessions, there was nothing of
picturesque interest outside the occasional appearance
in the witness-box of Irish peasants who
were called upon to bear witness, in Doric accents,
to the truth. Apart from these, the individuals
who gave testimony were a bunch of frock-coated,
plug-hatted Philistines of the most "orn'ery"
description, as they say out West, men who used
unfailingly to put the special writers to sleep.
In Parnell there was nothing, externally at least,
which could be said to be in any way picturesque,
and Biggar only came up to the specifications of
a very curious picture. Along, then, came Le
Caron, a veritable godsend to the correspondents
who were gaping for a bit of decent colour. The
Major may be trusted, as a man who had touched
hands with the American journalist, to have
realised and seized his opportunity. The obvious
Napoleon pose, the arms folded across the breast,
the sharp sibilant tones, the Westerner's "yus,
yus" and "no, siree," the Machiavellian suggestion
of knowing all there was to be known about
mystic shrines and tangled intrigues, the obvious
consciousness of being the apparent villain of
the piece who was finally, he thought, to issue
as its real hero, the glacial fixity of the stare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the pose of long-suffering righteousness—yes,
the spy in the witness-box was exactly what
the New Journalists were looking for, and in
making Le Caron they were helping to make
themselves.</p>

<small>SCHULMEISTER</small></h2>


<p>Of all modern spies, Karl Schulmeister, Napoleon's
chief secret-service agent, appears to have
possessed mental and temperamental qualities of
so high an order as to justify one's belief that
in the business of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute politique</i> he might have
played a prominent rôle, had his destiny lain that
way. As it was, he played in the Napoleonic
drama a part which, although practically unknown
even to well-informed students of history,
may be said to have contributed an important
quota not only to the Corsican's achievement of
his lofty position in the world, but also in some
measure to its retention. And although Napoleon
made his chief spy a rich man and allowed him to
hold in his time many positions of consideration
if not of honour, such as the organisation of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espions</i> and the headship of the imperial
secret police, it is a matter of definite record that
he consistently and to the end refused to bestow
on Schulmeister any decoration of honour. In
what degree and to what extent the work of the
spy was less dignified or honourable than that of
Fouché, the high-placed minister of police, is not
easily apparent and it seems hard to find any real
justification for Napoleon's refusal to Schulmeister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>of a pectoral certificate of worth when we reflect
on the personal and public character of the heavily
bedizened Duc d'Otranto who, apart from his
long career of duplicity and intrigue, was eventually
to prove the agent of the Emperor's final
undoing and betrayal. In view of our expressed
opinion that megalomania largely underlies the
psychology of the spy, it is interesting to note
that Schulmeister also laid claim to the honour of
lofty birth. His grandfather, he told the world
of his time, had been a Hungarian refugee noble
of the family of Biersky, who settled in Baden,
about 1730, where he adopted the profession of
schoolmaster, taking at the same time a name
descriptive of his occupation—hence Schulmeister.</p>

<p>What we know for a certainty is that the spy's
father was a kind of unattached or nonconforming
Lutheran minister at Neu-Freistett in 1760, and
that Karl Schulmeister was born here on 5th
August 1770, when Napoleon was about one
year old. The meagre accounts which remain
extant give us the picture of a village boy of
respectable position whose character bore a
striking resemblance to that which Robert Clive
earned among the townspeople of Market Drayton
in his early years. Schulmeister, at the age of
twelve, was the acknowledged leader of the local
band of youthful marauders and scapegraces—hooligans
we would call them in these days. At
the age of seventeen he had already become
known as one of the most accomplished smugglers
on the Franco-German frontier, a business, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>noteworthy, in which he engaged, either personally
or by proxy, to the closing years of his life. At the
age of twenty-two he married an Alsatian maid
called Unger, and established himself in two
distinct trades which his considerable smuggling
operations were likely to render lucrative at the
time. In after years, however, when he had
become the lord of a château and large pleasance,
and preferred to be known as Monsieur de Meinau,
the spy was prone to overlook the fact that he
had at one time kept a provision shop and an
ironmongery at Neu-Freistett. Smuggling he was
always willing to admit, and for the reason that
in Revolutionary times, when life was accounted
cheap, it required much courage and resource,
he said, to become a successful smuggler. Undoubtedly
the experience he acquired in this
dangerous trade had called for many of the
mental qualities which were to serve him so well
in his after-career.</p>

<p>About 1799 he was introduced to Colonel Savary,
afterwards to become the Duc de Rovigo, who
was then engaged on a minor commissarial mission
for the Directory in Alsatian countries. Savary
was evidently one of those fortunate individuals
on whom the gift of sensing great events to come
appears to be bestowed, and, like all of his kind,
he had both the eye for useful men and the talent
for attaching them. An acuminous judge of
character, he was first attracted to Schulmeister
by the latter's cool audacity and splendid resource
in the conduct of perilous smuggling enterprises,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>though whether, as it is said, Savary was himself
anxious to share in the very liberal profits of the
smuggler's trade, is not so clear. It is certain,
however, that the rising soldier and the prosperous
contrabandist continued to meet and to correspond,
so that in 1804, being commissioned to
allure a princely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emigré</i> across the French frontier,
in accordance with Napoleon's resolve to put a
term to conspiracies against his power by sacrificing
the blood of a Bourbon, Savary at once
remembered his friend Karl Schulmeister. The
man who had so long and successfully eluded the
excise officials at the frontier would in all probability,
he argued, prove easily equal to the task
of trapping a royalist on the wrong side of the
international boundary-line.</p>

<p>Entrusting the conduct of his business operations
to his wife, Schulmeister visited Savary at
Besançon early in March 1804. Here he was
definitely instructed by the French General—Savary
had been promoted to this rank in 1803—in
the details of the intrigue which was to
bring about the capture of the young Duc
d'Enghien, whose murder had been resolved upon
by the authority in Paris, its object being to strike
terror into the royalist camp and clear the way
towards a larger rôle for Bonaparte. Enghien
was at that time a young man of thirty-two
resident in the territory of the Grand Duke of
Baden close to the French frontier. Proscribed
like all the members of his House, he was admittedly
a man in whom a taste for political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>intrigue counted for little, too far removed from
possible succession to the throne of France to be
seriously suspected of ambitious designs and,
from what his contemporaries assure us, one who
represented the best type of his royal race. That
harshness of lot which was common to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emigré</i>
of every rank in those times did not spare the
young Duc, who lived in very unpretending
fashion at Ettenheim, a harmless dependent on
the bounty of England. Historical inquiry into
details connected with the residence of the young
Bourbon in Baden has entirely removed from
him all suspicion of having been in any way privy
to a conspiracy against the First Consul. It was
the Duc's custom often to visit Strassburg, where
lived a lady friend who was to prove a cruelly
unconscious agent in the intrigue which brought
about her lover's destruction.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plans which Schulmeister
laid down for the trapping of Enghien, this lady,
to whom the Bourbon was passionately attached,
was taken one morning by emissaries of the spy,
conveyed to Belfort across the French border and
interned at a country house near the frontier,
the reasons given for her detention being that she
had become an object of suspicion to the omnipotent
French authority. In the lady's name, a
letter was then forged by Schulmeister, purporting
to come from her to Enghien at Ettenheim, retailing
the misadventure and asking her lover to
use whatever means he could to procure her release
from the country house. This implicit appeal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>his chivalry was sufficient for the Duc, who, on
14th March, decided to see if by bribery he could
not himself effect the release of his mistress.
Acting just as the astute Schulmeister had foreseen,
Enghien left Ettenheim with two attendants
before midnight of the 14th, and it was at a hamlet
in Baden territory close to the frontier and near
Lorrach, that the spy's emissaries, all on the alert
and noting the opportunity of an easy capture,
seized upon his person. Thence the prince was
conveyed to Strassburg, from which city he was
taken to Vincennes, where, having undergone a
mock-trial, he was executed on 20th March at
dawn, his gaolers forcing him to hold a lantern so
that the bullets might find their mark. It may
be remembered that one of Enghien's last requests
was for permission to send a letter to his lady
friend, who, as soon as she had ceased to serve any
further purpose, was quickly released by Schulmeister.
This letter, it may be presumed, would
have conveyed the Duc's explanation for the
reasons which had prevented him from coming
to his mistress's aid as she had requested. It is
said that Savary, for whom the capture of Enghien
meant the certain continuance of Napoleon's
favour, paid the spy blood-money equal to £6000
for his successful entrapping of the Bourbon
prince.</p>

<p>Schulmeister was presented to the notice of
Napoleon by his patron Savary in 1805. "Here
is a man who is all brain and no heart, Sire," said
the General. Our spy has left a short description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>of Napoleon of those days, which contains, as
far as the writer knows, the only record of the
quality of the great soldier's voice, a more important
index of personality than is generally
supposed. According to Schulmeister, Napoleon's
voice was high-pitched, but crisp and with a
certain stridency, while his habit of speaking
through the teeth seemed also to give his utterances
a peculiarly hissing sound. For the rest,
the spy does not appear to have carried away a
marked impression of the conqueror's personal
appearance. The great soldier seems to have
treated the spy with a playful interest and kindliness,
and by the spring of 1805 we find that Schulmeister
had received a commission from him to
report upon the coastal towns of the south of
England. It is also said that the spy visited
Ireland, where he made it his business to become
acquainted with the remnants of the rebels of
1798, who still placed a somewhat simple trust in
Napoleon's vague promise, expressed, if at all,
through third parties, that he would some day
consider the question of attacking England
through Ireland, granting her independence to
the latter. Whether or not the English and
Irish visits were ever paid, it is certain that
Napoleon, in thinking out the campaign of 1805,
especially remembered the existence of Karl
Schulmeister—in itself a rare tribute to the spy's
ability from a master-judge of clever and useful
agents. Napoleon, as we gather from historical
writers like Paul Muller, did not place an absolute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>confidence in the reliability of non-military spies.
"The spy is a natural traitor" was his expressed
view of the species. As a rule the Emperor trusted
to his military intelligence department to supply
him with all that information upon which he based
his complex strategic and tactical calculations.
The Austerlitz campaign in view, not so much of
the momentous political contingencies inherent
in the whole event, differed from others, however,
as to the character of some of the most prominent
actors engaged. It was on this account that an
apparently insignificant person like Schulmeister
came to play, in the stirring political drama of
1805, a rôle which in its way was almost as helpful
to Napoleon as his own genius in elaborating that
memorable episode.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Emperor, more than
all other generals, and true to the maxims of
Polyænus, made it invariably his business to
learn all he could about the personality and character
of any commander with whom he was about
to measure himself. With Alvinzy, Wurmser,
Beaulieu, the Archduke Charles and Mélas,
Napoleon had fought different types of battles
based to a large extent on the personal qualities
and disposition of the general whom he happened
to be opposing. In the early months of 1805,
Napoleon, always well served by his regular diplomatic
agents, may be trusted to have known the
names and characters of most of the commanders
to whom Austria and Russia were about to
entrust the command of their armies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>campaign which all Europe knew to be inevitable.
As to the attributes of Field-Marshal Mack, then
a man of fifty-three, he can have had but few
illusions and well knew that family influence,
rather than the possession of real ability, had given
the Austrian his high position in the military
councils of his country. In Mack was a dull
simplicity of mind, unusual to a man of his class,
added to the fatal quality of allowing himself
easily to be influenced by others. Conditions in
the Austrian army, which had within recent years
suffered a series of reverses at the hands of both
Bonaparte and Moreau, lent themselves easily to
irregular influences, a fact which had not escaped
the penetration of Napoleon. Mack, again, was
anxious to atone for his defeat by the French in
1797 and was prepared to take advantage of any
opportunity which should give him in the conflict
a superiority over the conqueror of Italy and
Austria.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1805 that opportunity presented
itself in the form of a letter which was
addressed to him from one Karl Schulmeister,
who, like many well-educated Alsatians, spoke
and wrote French and German equally well. The
writer in the course of a lengthy communication
informed the Field-Marshal that he had been
removed across the French frontier by Napoleon's
orders, on the ground that he was an Austrian
spy. Schulmeister admitted the facts. He had
been moved, he wrote, out of pure love of his
country and hatred of Napoleon, to act the spy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>through the imperial armies of France, as to
the equipment, plans, intentions and organisation
of which he was perfectly well acquainted. All
this information he was willing to give up on the
condition of being allowed to serve on the staff
of the Austrian army. Then followed an account
of his Hungarian ancestry and many other details
which need not be particularised here. It is
sufficient to say that Mack eagerly seized the
opportunity of possessing himself of the services
of a man who knew all about the French army,
and engaged him as secret-service agent on his
own particular account. The spy, who had visited
Vienna in order to meet the Field-Marshal, was
furthermore given military rank, and Mack procured
him—on the ground of his noble Hungarian
descent, with forged attestations as to which
Napoleon's agents had supplied him at his own
request—membership of some of the most exclusive
military clubs in the Austrian capital.
As his supply of money, coming as it did from
Napoleon's long purse, was practically unlimited,
Schulmeister, the ex-smuggler and actual spy,
became an easy favourite in some of the most
exclusive circles in the proudest society in
Europe.</p>

<p>A description of the chief spy is given by
M. de Gassicourt, a member of the medical suite of
Napoleon: "Schulmeister is a man of rare courage
and imperturbable presence of mind. He is
made for great activities, his shoulders being
broad, his chest deep, his body not tall, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>capable of sustained exertions. His face is like
an impenetrable mask." A German writer—an
anonymous journalist in the <cite>Courier du Bas-Rhin</cite>,
who has written much about the spy's career—describes
Schulmeister as "one who ever seemed
to affect the air of a man on whom the safety of
the State depended." While absolutely incapable
of the commonest feelings of humanity where
strict business was concerned, as in the murder of
Enghien, the spy appears to have considered it
an indispensable part of his social equipment to
waltz like a gentleman of the old court of Versailles,
and with this momentous object in view
employed the services of the most eminent dancing
masters. His manners were said to be excellent
by men who were sufficiently good judges, and, in
any case, he must have acquired considerable
polish to have passed muster in Austrian society
of that age. He had not been long in Vienna,
at all events, before he had attached to his own
service, and of course for cash considerations, two
well-known military men, who, when Mack took
command of his army in the autumn of 1805,
accompanied him to the Front, Schulmeister also
proceeding thither as head of the military intelligence
department attached to Mack's forces.
During all this time he successfully contrived to
keep closely in touch with Napoleon, from whom
he was now taking sums of money for necessary
expenditure and salary which, according to
documents in the National Archives of France,
containing much of the spy's correspondence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>amounted to a sum equal to at least £20,000
per annum of our own money. Like most of
the spy species, Schulmeister was a high liver,
although Napoleon, a hard enough critic of
accounts of all kinds, never laid any complaint
to his charge on the ground of unnecessary extravagance.</p>

<p>Mack, as we have seen, was one of those men
who easily surrender their will-power to bolder
spirits. Accordingly, Schulmeister, who possessed
the Austrian's complete confidence and who was
well assisted by his Austrian fellow-spies, Wend
and Rulski, acting on the instructions transmitted
to him by Napoleon's headquarters, kept the
Field-Marshal, by means of forged communications
purporting to come from traitors in the
French camp, falsely informed as to the movements
of the three advancing imperial armies.
As an aristocrat and a convinced supporter of all
feudalistic forms and ideals, Mack was easily led
to believe that the newly established throne of
the Corsican received but half-hearted adherence
from the French people. Napoleon even had
newspapers especially printed which were to be
shown to Mack in order to strengthen this impression.
According, also, to letters supplied
by the spy, Napoleon, who had left Paris with
Vienna as his objective, had been forced to return
with the greater part of his armies in order
to quell a revolution which had broken out
against his throne on his departure from the
French capital. Coincident reports, supplied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Schulmeister's paid collaborants, seemed to point
to the truth of the Alsatian's startling intelligence,
and acting upon it, the Austrian Field-Marshal,
with an army of 30,000 men, issued from the city
of Ulm in pursuit of what he thought to be the
retreating French armies only to find himself
surrounded by a ring of steel, or what Napoleon
was wont to term his "necklace" manœuvre,
Soult, Marmont, Lannes, Ney, Dupont and Murat
closing him in on all sides. The memorable
capitulation of the city, a pivotal point in the set
strategy of Austria's military plans for the campaign
of 1805, followed at once, Mack paying the
penalty of what was for long thought to be an
act of treachery, by being deprived of his rank,
with a further punishment of two years in a
military fortress. As for Schulmeister himself,
his audacity never showed itself more conspicuously
than in the immediate sequel. Not content
with having practically assured to Napoleon the
success of what is known as the Austerlitz campaign,
admittedly the most spectacular of all the
Emperor's military exploits, the spy, after Mack's
disgrace, repaired to Vienna, where in the chief
military councils, which were attended by the
Emperor Francis and the Emperor of Russia, he
is said to have counselled plans which were sure,
he said, to enable the Allies to offset the disaster
of Ulm and redeem the situation. Strange though
it appears, his views, supported as usual by forged
letters of intelligence, were applauded by the
military commanders present, and the result was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>the shattering of the Austro-Russian armies at
Austerlitz on 2nd December 1805. On the
morrow of that memorable conflict, the spy was
arrested at the instance of highly placed persons
in Vienna who had long suspected him. The
timely arrival of the French saved him, however,
from a felon's fate, and it is said that by
January 1806 he was back in Paris, boasting to
his friends of the large amounts of money he
had accumulated out of payments made to him
not only by the French but also by the—Austrians!</p>

<p>It is impossible to trace Schulmeister in anything
like recordful fashion between 1806 and
1809. His name is occasionally mentioned in
connection with the missions of Savary, who
always gave his confidence to the spy and entrusted
him on occasion with rendering military
and political reports in hostile territory, and experts
agree in the opinion that these reports were
drawn up with the skill and precision of an exceptionally
well-endowed critic of strategic and
diplomatic values. On Napoleon's second visit
to Vienna, the spy was appointed censor over
theatres, publishing houses, religious establishments
and newspapers, and as indicating his
possession of a large political sense, it may be
pointed out that he had the works of Voltaire,
Diderot, Helvetius, Montesquieu and Holbach
translated and scattered broadcast among the
various races of Austria-Hungary, in furtherance
of the liberal ideas of the Revolution which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Napoleon claimed to represent. All these productions
had up till that time been included on
the <i>Index</i>, political as well as religious. In 1809,
for a short season, he occupied the important
position of commissary-general of the imperial
armies in the field. At Landshut he distinguished
himself by leading a troop of hussars in person
and capturing several important positions. In
the same year he reappeared in Strassburg, still
under Savary's orders, and in the course of a revolt
which he was called upon to quell, distinguished
himself by blowing out the brains of one of the
most violent agitators, the trouble ceasing forthwith.
At Strassburg he was always at home and
to the very end held his popularity among all
classes.</p>

<p>Some years previously he had purchased in
the neighbourhood of his old home the important
Château Le Meinau and in 1807 had become also
the proprietor of an estate called De Piple, not
far from Paris. In that year, too, he began to
use the territorial distinction—Monsieur de
Meinau. At both mansions people knew him for
his lavish hospitalities, the magnificence of his
receptions and routs, his unfailing generosity to
the poor of his districts and, above all, for his love
of little children—this last trait an easily comprehensible
transition, it may be supposed, from
the vicious intrigues of his complex trade, to the
confiding simplicity of guileless minds. His
property was said in those years to be worth
the equivalent of £200,000, some said much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>more, and it is quite certain that Napoleon
rewarded him generously for his undoubted
services to the imperial throne.</p>

<p>His last important work in an official capacity
was executed also in 1809 when, through the
influence of the ever-obliging Savary, Schulmeister
was appointed by Napoleon to act as chief of
the secret police during that famous Congress of
Erfurt to which the Corsican commanded the
presence of nearly all the sovereign princes of
Continental Europe. In the voluminous correspondence
which the spy conducted—his particular
Atticus being Savary—Schulmeister, whose pen
was clearly as fluent as his wits were nimble, keeps
his patron, who, it will be remembered, afterwards
succeeded Fouché as head of the French
ministry of police, in full touch with the intrigues
of that historic gathering of European celebrities.
None was too low or unweighty, nor any too
highly placed to escape the often hypercritical
and always interesting comments of the all-observing
spy. The result is that apart from
details bearing on the political significance of the
Congress we are also regaled with tittle-tattle
concerning the often far from dignified relations
of the Tsar Alexander, as well as other august
personages, with the subsidiary grand army of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</i> who had taken advantage of the
opportunity afforded them by the afflux of wealthy
princes and nobles from every capital, to accumulate
profit during the process of the congressional
sun. The Corsican, with his omnivorous sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>intrigue, laid particular emphasis on the necessity
of closely watching the movements of Russia's
Emperor, whose taste in venal characters of the
<i>hetaira</i> type was often in the inverse ratio of his
exalted station. Napoleon, indeed, found himself
more than once under the necessity of reproving
the Imperial Muscovite whose attentions to a
celebrated French actress with whom the Corsican
himself had once been on the best of terms, very
much perturbed him. "Visit that woman," he
said, with the coarseness of the soldier, "and to-morrow
all Europe will know what your physical
proportions are from the ground up." Schulmeister
had even explicit orders to note the
movements of the fair Queen Louise of Prussia,
her personal attractions for the Tsar also providing
a source of much soul-burning to the French
Emperor, who, whether he were well informed
or not, allowed no opportunity to escape him
of aspersing the much-humiliated Queen to
Alexander. Goethe himself, despite all the admiration
the Corsican professed for the Sage of
Weimar, was not sacred from Napoleon's agent.
The insistent "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce Monsieur de Goet'—qui voit-il?</span>"
was hardly less frequent on imperial lips than
that other demand: "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Et l'Empereur Alexandre—où
a-t-il passé la nuit dernière?</span>" These were
types of implicit instructions which were daily
issued to his spy by the sometimes least dignified
of sovereigns.</p>

<p>Readers of the Imperial legend will remember
well the young General Lasalle, Napoleon's most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>famous leader of light cavalry. This soldier
was also the possessor of many of those characteristics
which we are accustomed to associate
with that harmless enough social type which is
described by the term, "funny man." The
General's peculiar aptitude for cutting strange
and grotesque figures, his talent for distorting his
features into the most singular of grimaces, his
capacity for assimilating strong drinks, as well as
his unfailing geniality with all sorts of men, were
traits as well known to the Army as the theatrical
dress-manias of Murat, or the boastfulness of
General Rapp. It is not surprising to learn, therefore,
that Schulmeister, between 1800 and 1809—Lasalle
was killed at Wagram, in the latter
year—was on terms of great intimacy with the
young General. Well aware of the high favour
with which Napoleon regarded his cavalry leader,
Schulmeister confided to the latter the secret of
his great ambition. He had riches, he said, far
beyond his needs and everything, indeed, which
was capable of satisfying the heart of ambitious
man. He lacked, however, the one especial
decoration on which his aspirations were set.
That was—of all things—the Legion of Honour!
The bestowal of that distinction would, he declared,
cap his noblest and most honourable
ambitions. Would Lasalle use his undoubted
influence with the Emperor to procure him that
supreme testimony of Imperial good will? The
General, accordingly, informed Napoleon of his
chief spy's aspiration only (a writer says) to draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>from the great soldier what was probably the only
horse-laugh in which the conqueror had ever
indulged. "Schulmeister," said the Emperor,
"may have all the money he wants, but the
Legion of Honour—never!" With the Emperor
himself the spy was, nevertheless, on terms which
were cordial enough. It was Napoleon's custom
to address him by his Christian name "Karl,"
and, in the presence of others particularly, to
twit him, often in the most cruel terms, on the
despicable nature of his trade. The Emperor's
refusal to include him among the wearers of the
famous Order which he founded is not to be
explained on very logical grounds, seeing that the
decoration was worn by soldiers like Radet, whose
chief business in the Army seemed to be the execution
of, frankly, dirty jobs, from the performance
of which the far from squeamish officers of the
Corsican shrank with wholesome aversion. Such,
for example, was the invasion of the Vatican and
the arrest of a harmless old Bishop like Pius <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr>,
or the supervision of the incarcerated Black
Cardinals who had refused in 1810, on religious
grounds, to attend the church ceremony which
gave Napoleon a second wife in the person of Marie
Louise.</p>

<p>On the advent of this Austrian Archduchess
to share the Imperial throne, Viennese influence
at the Court of Napoleon began to count in Paris
as an important enough factor. Sufficiently important,
at any rate, to put a term to the activities
of the man who had been to a great extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>responsible for the debâcle of Austria's military
and political schemes in 1805. Schulmeister accordingly
disappeared from Paris, selling his estate
near Paris and retiring to his splendid property
at Meinau, where his popularity with the Alsatians
was so great as to justify the belief that the spy
was generously endowed with many qualities other
than those which had led him to adopt the trade
of espionage. "He is a spy," his countrymen
used to say, "but surely also a gallant man." In
1814, during the invasion of France, a regiment of
Austrian artillery was especially detailed to demolish
his mansion and to destroy as much of his
personal property as possible. The spy returned
to Paris during the Hundred Days, only to be
arrested when Napoleon left for Belgium. He was
released on paying over so large a ransom that
his fortune was permanently crippled. On the
return of the Bourbons, all his attempts to play
a social rôle were severely frowned down by the
friends of his prosperous days, and with the small
remnants of a fortune which unfortunate speculations
had now reduced to the vanishing point, he
returned to Alsace, there to live a life of lean days
and pathetic obscurity. As late as 1840 he was
the keeper of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bureau de tabac</i>, one of those tobacco
stalls which are given to Frenchmen as a solatium
for public services in the lower grades. He was
alive in 1850 when the Prince-President toured
through Alsace, but refused to bring himself to
the notice of the nephew of Napoleon. The
President called on him, however, vouchsafing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>him an honour which he had never received
from the great Captain—namely, a handshake.
He died in 1853 and was buried near his wife
and parents in the cemetery of Saint Urbain in
Strassburg.</p>

<small>NATHAN HALE</small></h2>


<p>On studying the career of Nathan Hale, who, with
Major André, owes his historicity to the American
War of Independence, one is conscious of being
in touch with a character at once dangerous and
difficult, to quote the words in which an eminent
English statesman has described the mystic who
is at the same time a practical man. In Hale, as
his private correspondence clearly shows, there
was every indication that an otherwise reasonable
and lovable disposition was supplemented by a
deep-running current of that hard fanaticism
which has ever marked your descendant of the
Pilgrim Fathers. Like his fellow-spy André,
Hale was a man whose social and intellectual
gifts were of an important order, while the admitted
excellence of the man's private character,
as well as his high sense of personal honour, go a
long way to justify the opinion generally held by
Americans regarding the motives which induced
Hale to enter into the business of spying—according
to that view, a pure love of the principle of
liberty, which prompted him to risk his life in the
service of his country. "Spies," says Vattel,
"are usually condemned to capital punishment
and not unjustly, there being hardly any other way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>of preventing the mischief which they do. For
this reason a man of honour who would not expose
himself to die by the hand of a common executioner,
ever declines serving as a spy. He considers
such work disgraceful, as it can seldom be
done without some kind of treachery." Hale
himself gave recorded expression, however, to
his view of the matter when he said that, "every
kind of service necessary for the public good
becomes honourable by being necessary"—a view
which is quite in keeping with that mysticism
which ever characterises the fanatic who claims
the support of spiritual principles for his acts.
Again, Hale declared: "I wish to be useful. If
the exigencies of my country demand a peculiar
service, its claims to the performance of that
service are imperious." André, on the other
hand, stated that in the ill-starred enterprise
into which he threw himself, he was mainly
"actuated by a thirst for military glory, the
applause of his countrymen and perhaps a
brigadiership"—clearly a true megalomaniac.
Indeed, André's last words gave the key to the
large personal vanity which underlay his undoubtedly
interesting character: "I call upon
you all, gentlemen, to bear witness that I die
like a brave man." Hale indicated a purely
ethical or religious attachment to the ideas inherent
in Independence doctrines of liberty, when
he made his last utterance: "I only regret that
I have but one life to sacrifice for my country"—the
true spirit of the Coliseum martyr. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>young American was willing to give up life itself
for his idea of liberty.</p>

<p>The Hale family, originally of the Kentish
family of that name, had been settled since 1635
in various parts of the New England States, the
country of the Puritan settlers. The parents of
Richard and Elizabeth Hale were, it is on record,
of the strictest sect of Puritans of their day.
The Bible was to them the speaking voice of the
Almighty, says a friend of the family; their
admirable civic virtues were also based upon the
religion that was in them and they respected the
Law because they recognised its divine origin.
Records still extant emphasise the important fact
that the domestic life of the Hale family was
one in which practical religion played a leading
part. Nathan Hale was born in 1755, the sixth
of twelve children, and from his earliest days was
destined for the ministry. With this object he
was entered at Yale College in 1771, after an uneventful
village life in the course of which he gave
evidence of a more than usually studious nature.
Of the famous American University he became
a graduate in 1773, leaving there in that year
to take up the profession of teaching. All contemporary
writers agree in attributing to young
Hale a singularly engaging personality as well as
a presence which was conspicuous among men
whose physical excellence was of a splendid type.
"Six feet high, perfectly proportioned, in figure
and deportment, he was the most manly man I
ever saw," wrote an enthusiastic college friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>who added the interesting fact that "all the girls
in New Haven fell in love with him and wept
tears of real sorrow when they heard of his sad
fate. Ever willing to lend a helping hand to a
being in distress, brute or human, he was overflowing
with good humour and the idol of his
acquaintances." During his university days
Hale had made a mark in the debating society and
his political speeches were remarkable, it is recorded,
for a strong advocacy of those principles
of personal liberty which had reached America
by way of France, then in the final stage of that
academic propaganda which was so soon to
precipitate the catastrophe of the Revolution.
Determined to devote his life to teaching, and
with a view to obtaining ultimately a professorship
at his old university, Hale settled down to
the prosaic enough life of a New England schoolmaster,
devoting his extra-professional hours to
the study of science, ethics and literature.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the War of Independence with
the battle of Lexington, 19th April 1775, upset the
philosophic dreams of the Connecticut teacher.
Throughout the New England States, action was
at once and almost unanimously called for, and
among those who became earnest advocates of
patriotic endeavour, young Hale began to take a
prominent place. "Let us march at once," he
cried, "nor ever lay down our arms till we have
obtained our independence." Hale was, indeed,
the first speaker to voice the popular notion of
freedom from the union with Great Britain. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>co-operation with kindred spirits, he set about
the forming of a local regiment for immediate
service at the Front. He himself eventually
enlisted in Webb's corps, a kind of territorial
organisation for local defence. In 1775 Hale was
present with his regiment at the siege of Boston,
where his conspicuous activities won him a
captaincy. The British were driven from that
city in March 1776 and sailed for Halifax, the
American forces in their turn moving on New
York. That Hale's patriotism was of a purely
disinterested kind would seem to be shown by
the fact that he himself paid for the services of
many of his enlisted men. At New York Hale
distinguished himself at once by capturing a
British vessel carrying large supplies, a midnight
raid of much danger which secured for his regiment
provisions for a lengthy subsistence and to himself
the notice of General Washington, by whom he
was presently to be entrusted with the carrying
out of a mission the successful results of which
must react decisively on the whole war. The
commission entrusted to Hale was nothing less
than the penetration of the enemy's plan of
campaign, an absolutely necessary condition of
success for the Revolutionary commanders and
for the following reasons:—</p>

<p>After the various actions which compelled the
retreat of the insurgents from Long Island, the
main American army in Manhattan, owing to
the demoralised state of its men, ill-clad, half-starved
and unpaid as they were, seemed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>on the point of dissolution. In a force which
on paper totalled 20,000 men, desertion and
disease had discounted one-third of the numbers.
Opposed to them was a British army of 25,000
strong, supported by a powerful naval force.
Its soldiers were veterans who had already
tasted success and were magnificently equipped
with artillery, stores and war-munitions of every
sort. The military crux which confronted
Washington was the defence or the abandonment
of New York, the strategic key of the existing
military situation. Unable, owing to inaction
to which his topographical position as well as the
hesitations of Congress condemned him, to divine
the real intentions of the British, Washington instructed
his lieutenants to obtain at all hazards
correct information as to the designs of the
enemy's generals. "Leave no stone unturned,"
he wrote to General Heath, "nor do not stick at
expense to bring this to pass, as I was never more
uneasy than on account of my want of knowledge
on this score." The vital matter was to find out
at which point, if at all, the British intended to
attack New York. Such being the situation, it
was decided to send a competent observer in
disguise into the British lines on Long Island,
in order to penetrate the momentous secret, and
Nathan Hale volunteered for the execution of the
perilous undertaking.</p>

<p>It is recorded that when Colonel Knowlton, on
calling the insurgent officers together, suggested
that one of them should volunteer his services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>for what was undoubtedly the work of a spy, a
murmur of indignation went round the room.
Many of the officers in bitter terms reproached
the Colonel for having dared to carry such a
suggestion to men of honour, even from Washington
himself. Knowlton replied that he was only
carrying out his General's instructions, but nevertheless
managed to insinuate in his reply that the
reward in the way of promotion for the successful
achievement of the mission would be proportioned
to the danger with which it was undoubtedly
fraught. His fellow-officers, to whom Hale's
high spirit and probity were well-known characteristics,
little expected that the Captain would
prove the very first to undertake the work of a
common spy. Nevertheless Hale was the only
man, among a band of men of undoubted courage,
who could be found to respond to the suggestion.
His friends, in no way deterred, indeed, rather
encouraged, by the presence of Knowlton, whose
proposal they considered as an insult, used all the
arts of persuasion at their command to turn him
from his purpose, but without success. Hale in
accepting the perilous commission addressed them
as follows:—</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I think I owe to my country the
accomplishment of an object so important and
so much desired by the commander of her armies,
and I know no mode of obtaining the information
but by assuming a disguise and passing into the
enemy's camp. I am fully sensible of the consequences
of discovery and capture in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>situation. But for a year I have been attached
to the Army and have not rendered any material
service while receiving a compensation for which I
make no return. Yet am I not influenced by any
expectation of promotion or pecuniary reward. I
wish to be useful, and every kind of service necessary
for the public good becomes honourable by
being necessary. If the exigencies of my country
demand a peculiar service its claims to the performance
of that service become imperious."</p>

<p>On the same afternoon Hale met Washington
for the second time, receiving from the General
instructions with regard to the perilous task he
had undertaken. He was also given a general
order addressed to American shipmasters to
convey Captain Hale to any part of Long Island
on which he might desire to land. Sundown
already saw him on his way, accompanied by a
sergeant and a boatman, to a point fifty miles
north of New York, Norwalk, where there was a
safe crossing of the Sound into territory occupied
by British forces. Dismissing his companions at
dawn on 15th September, and exchanging into the
brown civilian dress and Quaker hat common to
that period, Hale ferried across the narrow water,
instructing his retainers at the last moment to
await him at the same spot with a boat on 20th
September. Reaching Huntington Bay on the
other side, he assumed the character of a schoolmaster
who, disgusted with the course of the
Revolutionary cause, had come to pursue his
profession in surroundings more congenial to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>political and social tastes. His appearance and
speech both carried conviction to all with whom
he conversed; he was made free of the British
lines, visited all the camps on Long Island, making
observations openly and drawing up memoranda,
written in Latin, as well as plans, in the privacy
of his room. In the meantime, the British had
invaded Manhattan and captured New York,
so that as far as the penetration of the designs
of English commanders was concerned, Hale had
really made his excursion to little purpose beyond
what he had achieved in the gathering of military
information on Long Island. Having heard of
the British success, he retraced his steps in the
direction of Norwalk, and on 18th September, at
sundown, found himself again at Huntington Bay,
where he had first landed on his mission. Wearing
coarse shoes with loose inner soles, under which
he was able comfortably to conceal his drawings
and memoranda, and still in the plain dress of a
middle-class citizen, he felt secure in the disguise
which had already carried him so happily through
the perils of many British camps. Accordingly
he entered a famous tavern "The Cedars" and
asked for a night's lodging. At his entrance, a
number of persons were in the lounge, and one of
them, a man whose face he seemed to recollect,
suddenly rose and left the place. Hale spent the
night at the hostelry and at dawn left for the
waterside in quest of the boat which he had
ordered to be ready. Agreeably surprised to find
his supposed boatman so punctual, he gaily saluted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>an approaching skiff which was carrying several
men. Hastening to the beach in expectation of
meeting his friends, he discovered to his dismay
that the boat was manned by British marines.
Flight was impossible; he was seized, taken
aboard and conveyed to the British guard-ship
<i>Halifax</i>. His capture, it is said, had been brought
about by the stranger whom he had recognised
the previous night at "The Cedars," a distant
cousin of disreputable habits, who had betrayed
him to the British. Proper warrant is, however,
lacking for this part of the story. Inevitably his
captors found full proofs of the purport of his
adventure and he was conveyed to the headquarters
of General Howe who, on the evidence
of the concealed papers, summarily condemned
him to death by hanging.</p>

<p>In the presence of Howe Hale frankly admitted
his rank and mission. "I was present," wrote
a British officer who was an eye-witness of the
closing scenes, "and observed that the frankness,
the manly bearing and the evidently disinterested
patriotism of the handsome young prisoner
sensibly touched a tender chord of General Howe's
nature; but the stern rule of war concerning such
offences would not allow him to exercise even
pity."</p>

<p>As might be expected from such a man, Hale
met his doom with the iron firmness of one who
is convinced of the righteousness of his purpose.
His last requests to Cunningham, the provost-marshal
who supervised the execution, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>refused, and even his poor, hurriedly written letters
to his mother, his sisters and his youthful betrothed,
Alice Adams, were ruthlessly destroyed
before his face. There was, indeed, a real nobility
about the whole person and demeanour of Hale
which, as is commonly enough the case, called
forth the brutality and coarseness of the completely
opposite nature of Cunningham, who
jeeringly requested the doomed youth to make
his dying speech. And Hale replied, in words
which still ring in the spirit of the Independence
Fathers:</p>

<p>"I only regret that I have but one life to give
to my country."</p>

<small>MACK AND THE MOLLY MAGUIRES</small></h2>


<p>James M'Parlan, a North-of-Ireland man, must
be ranked among the most successful spies in
modern times and for the good reason that he
was mainly instrumental in breaking up one of
the most lawless and terrible conspiracies against
public order and private liberty which any state
has yet been called upon to suppress. Its home
was Pennsylvania, its name the "Molly Maguires,"
and to find a parallel to its iniquitous arts and
methods one must go to the Klux Klan, the
Corsican Vendetta or the White Veil society of the
Middle Ages in Italy. As the discovery of gold
in Australia and California in the middle of the
nineteenth century led to the commission of a
vast amount of crime by reason of the peculiar
character of the masses of adventurers who soon
overran the gold-bearing regions, so also the
discovery of anthracite coal in Pennsylvania led
to the assembling of great camps of speculators
and prospectors, wealthy capitalists and common
labourers for whom the word Law meant next to
nothing at all. The comparatively unorganised
condition of new towns which had sprung up as
if by magic in the anthracite zones made Pennsylvania
in those days a likely jumping-off ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>for any man who possessed good physique, a brutal
bearing, a disregard of private rights and the
ability to impose his ideas upon a band of men
of his own kind and kidney. Knowing what we
know of the enterprising courage of many types
of Irishmen and their talent for the business of
pioneering, it is not difficult to imagine that
they swarmed to the valuable coal regions of the
Quaker State in legions proportionate to the
vast immigrant hordes of their countrymen that
were then flowing into every port of the United
States. Great settlements consisting only of
Irishmen sprang up at once in the mining districts
of Pennsylvania and this new Irish colony
separated automatically into as many divisions
as there were counties in Ireland itself, each
section carrying with it all the local pride, prejudice
and other characteristics which had
marked it within its geographical bounds in the
old home. In fact a New Ireland sprang up
in Quaker State hardly differentiable from the
Old.</p>

<p>Most people who have read the story of Ireland
divested of that halo of cloistral romance, sentiment
and song, which presents Erin in the mellow
light of a land of untroubled repose, are well aware
that in all its recorded ages, paying due credit to
its title to religiosity, it has been a country
which for inter-racial animosities and political
divisions is comparable only with that aggregation
of states which until historical research and
record had presented them as they truly were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>once bore the half-sacred name of Greece. In
Ireland the man of the North differs from the man
of the South and rarely likes him, the people of
the West do not understand the masses of the East
and do not want to; we have the stout Men of
Munster who scorn the Scottish Huguenots of
the North as alien intruders, while the Gentleman
of Leinster affects to despise his hard-working
and thrifty countryman from Connaught. In a
land like this it is not hard to imagine that those
who possess a talent for prospering by the promotion
of political intrigue and secret societies
find themselves at once in an element which is
entirely congenial to themselves and their schemes,
as well as fruitful of profit in every sense of
the word. Their objects, too, are made all the
more easily attainable by reason of that peculiar
trait in the Irishman's temper which makes him
regard an act of treachery to the covenants of any
secret organisation, no matter what its objects,
as the most hateful of all traitorous acts. It has
been well said, indeed, that in Ireland "to inform
of a crime is nearly always considered as bad as
the crime itself, and to such an extent has this
feeling developed that it has become a part of
the Irish character and is universal in its application."
In a large measure owing to this contempt
of the informer by Irishmen, all manner of crime
has at all times and in all places gone undetected
in every part of the world where Irishmen have
developed large Irish settlements, and it was
precisely for the foregoing reasons that the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Molly Maguire Conspiracy was, in the first place,
able to come into existence and, in the second,
able by the black secrecy attending upon its
criminal operations, to mystify the authorities
of a great State of the Union for more than a
generation. The long series of murders committed
by this infamous body in the Pennsylvania coal
regions were revolting and brutal to the most
cold-blooded degree, were entirely without the
barest elements of justification, and for the most
part were perpetrated for grievances of a wholly
childish and imaginary kind, based mainly on
mere personal dislike or other trivial reasons of
the sort.</p>

<p>The iniquitous exploits of "Boycott" propagandism
in Land League days, which possessed
at least a semblance of political motive underlying
them, were respectable when compared with
the foul and wanton killings of the Molly Maguires
in America—a body, it may here be said, which
derived its peculiar name from the fact that to
every warning its agents addressed to an intended
victim there was invariably attached the generic
signature "Molly Maguire." An unfriendly
attitude towards the Mollies, the least suspicion
of being anxious to uproot them, common race
feeling, and, as we have said, simple personal
dislike were each and all sufficient to bring upon
any man visitation from the band in the form of
a card bearing the fateful name. Private and
public denunciation and the dispatch of threatening
letters invariably preceded the killing which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>was not only not to be denounced, but which was
to be treated by all who knew of its commission
as if it had never taken place. The mangled
Molly Maguire corpse came, accordingly, to rank
in a class by itself among all other corpses, enshrouded
as it usually was with a general and
sacrosanct mystery regarding the manner in which
life had come to leave it. Murders were commonly
committed during the dinner-hour of the
miners who, so frequent was a crime, would go
on calmly eating their meal while a fellow-man
was being dispatched to a happier world than this
not fifty yards away; and if his bloody passing
called up a feeling of pity in the breast of one of
the diners, it was only to be squelched at once
with the chorus "Shure wasn't the man war-rned"—meaning
that a man might be warned of possessing
too ambitious a wife, or the fact that he was
"putting on th'airs iv a jintleman," or that he
may have been trying to ingratiate himself into
the favour of a capitalist who happened not to be
in sympathy with Irishmen, or, indeed, perhaps
that he had been seen "iv a Sunda' wearin' peg-top
throusers, no less." On receipt of a card
bearing the signature of doom, if the recipient
did not desist from "anny of the said coorses,"
he had only himself to blame if a band of Mollies
visited him one fine night and bludgeoned his
body into releasing the soul.</p>

<p>One of the chief shareholders of a great coal-bearing
area, Franklin Goven by name, decided,
to his lasting credit and with the support of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>right-minded Irishmen in America, to subsidise
from his own pocket a movement to destroy this
band of chartered assassins. Acting in concert
with important public men in Philadelphia, he
applied to the famous Pinkerton Detective
Agency for the assistance of an expert in tracking
the organisation to its original sources and destroying
it for good and all. After full preliminary
inquiries, the Agency decided that the
ramifications of the secret organisation were so
complex and so comprehensive that the real truth
as to the operation of its methods could only be
reached by planting a spy amidst the very band
itself. To this end were enlisted the services of
M'Parlan, who under the name of M'Kenna set
about the destruction of one of the foulest criminal
societies yet known to the world. Mack, as he
became known ever afterwards, accordingly began,
in 1873, his almost hopeless task of tracing the
source of the perpetration of some hundred
murders which had taken place within a few
years preceding, to make no mention of hundreds
of maimings, mutilations and other horrors which
were to be attributed to the same propagandism.
From the outset it was discovered by Mack, in
the course of preliminary goings and comings
in the coal country, that connected with the
Ancient Order of Hibernians, a well-established
benefit society chartered by the Legislature of the
State, there was an inner movement composed of
members of the Hibernians who were subsidising
a criminal organisation of wide-reaching power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>and influence, not unlike the Italian Black Hand
society of our own day. It was clear that at the
head of the society was an open and properly
constituted body, and connected with it was a
secret and criminal movement. Mack began his
subsequent sleuth work in approved Irish fashion
by becoming a regular customer at one of those
low-class Pennsylvania coal-town drinking shops—"speak-easies"
they are called by the police,
who are well aware that many men who visit
them are not the sort loudly to advertise the
methods by which they make their living. Here
he entered on friendly terms with the landlord,
Patrick Dormer by name. Mack, it was certain,
was a gifted soul and in every sense what your
American so expressively terms "a good mixer";
could sing a rowdy song, foot it to the moving
music and "cough up" the ready yarn when it
came to his turn. Moreover, he could "keep his
end up" when it meant replenishing the convivial
glasses, while his passion for what is known
as being in the thick of a purely personal mix-up
soon made him the most popular Irishman in the
coal zones. Most important of all, in view of his
especial business, he was what is known among
Americans as "a cold soak"—that is to say, he
could saturate his system with fire-water and still
command his intellect. While his boon companions
washed their sodden brains publicly in
their beer, Mack, always affecting to be easily
susceptible to the effects of Old Crow, was quietly
taking mental notes. Accordingly it was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>long before he discovered that his friends, when
under the influence of Bacchus, were apt to give
up certain secret pass-words. Having listened
to one of these several times, he carefully learned
the exact phrase, and soon after, finding the
landlord alone, he invited him to take a drink.
Leaning mysteriously over the counter he repeated
the mystic pass-word.</p>

<p>"What," cried the astonished landlord, "are
<em>you</em> one of them things?"—meaning a Molly
Maguire.</p>

<p>"Troth, that's what they call me," replied the
North-of-Ireland man.</p>

<p>Dormer unsuspectingly began from that day
to treat Mack as one of the insiders, taking his
word that he had been in the Hibernian Order at
Buffalo, but had been obliged to leave on account
of a serious crime. He was now, he confessed, in
hiding, and consequently became an object of
sympathy and solicitude to the Irishmen. When
it came, however, to introducing Mack to genuine
Hibernians, matters advanced less smoothly, since
the self-styled Molly did not understand the
"grip" and had only one single pass-word to back
his claim. And so it happened that on the
occasion of his being presented to one Cooney,
a Molly of note and standing, the latter, having
made certain signs which remained unanswered,
jumped from his toady-chair declaring that Mack
was an elemental liar. The spy brazened the
matter out, boldly called the bar for drinks and
pretending to have drunk too deeply fell in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>stupor to the floor. His enemy thereupon proposed
to disintegrate the spy by jumping on
him, but the "bunch" vetoed this proposal,
Mack being admittedly a good fellow. Again
Cooney took up the frenzied word, crying:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take his oath to it acrast his
mother's corp. No—not till he brung me a card
from his body-master."</p>

<p>To Mack, still prone upon his vertebræ, this
was good enough information. He was getting
into it by degrees. The Mollies, then, had grips,
pass-words, toasts, likewise body-masters; and
as he snored, he also registered the facts. Cooney
then "quit," and strangely enough Mack, so far
from being molested by anyone, was actually
taken to the hearts of the Mollies as one of themselves.
Thereafter there remained but the inner
ring to conquer and Mack, plentifully supplied
with money—the result, he pretended, of nefarious
tradings and misdoings—set about improving
his position. By violent and reckless talk he
soon won the confidence of his fellows and as he
boasted of having borne a hand in crimes which
had actually been perpetrated in years gone by,
and of which, as a detective, he must have known
the details, the local Mollies began to reflect that
in Mack they possessed a "hunch"—that is to say,
a man over whom they held a sword and who was
at the same time in intelligence, intrepidity and
means incomparably above his fellows. He was
described about this time: five feet eight inches
high, broad forehead, chestnut hair and of very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>genial aspect. Accordingly Mack was chosen to
be an active Molly. Subsequently and in the
course of the judicial proceedings which finally
broke up the Brotherhood, Mack was able to show
that he had never once engaged in the commission
of a planned crime and that by cipher and especially
prearranged telegrams he was able in many
cases to prevent the further commission of murders
in the coal regions.</p>

<p>That the double-dealing duties which fell to
Mack were of a perilous nature may be realised
from the fact that after a few months in residence
among the Mollies all his hair had fallen off, he
had lost his eyebrows and his sight had become
impaired. During this time his duties compelled
him to make unwilling love—the lady was
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exigeante</i>, worse luck—to the sister of a high-placed
Molly in order to extract special information.
And as for the quantities of vile whisky
he had found himself forced to swallow round the
low bars he frequented, Mack, commonly a sober
soul, declared afterwards that this was in many
ways the hardest part of his business. A period
came, however, when suspicion began to throw
its red eye upon him and his death, on general
principles and as a possible spy, was finally decided
upon. Other men might have excusably
enough fled the place, but this was too brave a
man to fail his employers just as he was on the
point of penetrating to the mystic shrine of
the organisation and finding out where "killing
orders" came from. One Kehoe, it was, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>suspecting Mack for a spy, called a number of
Mollies together and advocated the summary
murder of the man. Evidently Kehoe knew something,
for at this meeting he adjured his brethren
to take rapid action. "For God's sake," he cried,
"have him killed this very night that ever was,
or half the countryside will hang."</p>

<p>Accordingly it was decided to put Mack to
death and men were detailed to do the deed. On
that evening, it was known, the spy was to arrive
at the Shenandoah railway station, whence a
long stretch of lonely roadway led to the townlet
of that name. Mack arrived, the sole passenger,
and, to his surprise, was met by none of the Brotherhood.
This was a bad omen; but he decided to
go on, and made his way to the hotel of one
M'Andrew, whom he still considered to be his
friend. Affecting the usual cordiality, he entered
the house and parlour; but conversation becoming
at once strained, he realised that serious
business was in contemplation; two sentinels
were placed outside the house, one Sweeny remaining
in the room; he too got up dreamily
and left, telling the landlord he was going home.
Presently, however, he returned with a piece of
snow which he carelessly threw at M'Andrew's
feet, where it melted. This meant that time was
short and nothing was being done—an established
sign. M'Andrew looked at the spy, gave a groan
and said: "My feet are sore, I must take off
my boots," another sign which conveyed that as
men were not coming in sufficient numbers, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>business of murdering Mack would have to be
postponed. Mack, who, like all Mollies, was well
armed, accordingly left the place, making for his
lodgings by the highway. Once at home he spent
the night in self-defensive vigil and on the
morrow, early, two Mollies from a local camp
called upon him. With true Irish trust to chance
and the possible ignorance of the other man, they
declared they had come from Scranton by rail
and Mack was well aware that no train arrived
at such an hour from that town. These were,
however, the men who had been chosen overnight,
and after the last failure, to remove him. The
spy, always on his guard, told the men boldly he
was going straight to Kehoe's house to ask why
they had placed him under suspicion. Marching
from the house, he made for the hotel of M'Andrew,
whom he induced to accompany him to Kehoe's
by sleigh. The other two men decided also that
they would accompany Mack to Kehoe's and
hired a second sleigh. On the journey several
stops were made at intervening pot-houses, where
the victim-to-be treated his would-be murderers
to all they desired in the way of drink—and then
some. At Kehoe's the master of the house was
preparing to celebrate the slaying of Mack with
a dinner to a score of Mollies, and when the man
who was already supposed to be a "corp"
walked up to the house with a front of brass,
followed by his appointed murderers, both sorely
besotted, Kehoe began to pinch himself to see if
he might be dreaming. In the front parlour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>where the spy knew they would not dare to murder
him, were a dozen Mollies all celebrating his
slaughter in Old Crow, most of them already on
the blink. Mack entered the room after Kehoe
and did a bold thing: "Boys," he said, "you
are a band of foul murderers to seek to take the
life of the truest Molly in the whole bunch. Give
me the whisky." They handed him a glass filled
to the brim and the spy drained it. "Kehoe,"
he demanded, "what is it you have against me
and why do you want my life?" "Father
O'Connor knows all about you," retorted Kehoe.
"He knows you for a spy." Mack looked at his
watch and brazened it out. "Well then," says
he, "'tis Father O'Connor himself I will have
here, and by God I'll go and fetch him." Passing
from the house he met Mrs Kehoe, with whom he
was a favourite, and telling her how her husband
and his friends had put him on the mortuary list,
Mack reached his sleigh, M'Andrew following him.
At the priest's house, he was informed that Father
O'Connor had gone to a neighbouring town.
Under pretext of sending him a wire the spy then
drove to the station, reflecting wisely at this somewhat
overdrawn point that his mission was now
really at an end. He had timed his arrival well
but still had a few minutes to wait for the noon
train. In the short interval Mack feigned to be
busy drawing up his telegram to the priest. The
train arrived to the minute, and Mack, waiting
till the moment of its departure, threw down the
prepared message as the cars were drawing clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>of the platform, boarded the last carriage and
vanished for good from the coal regions. His
next appearance was made in the witness-box
at Philadelphia, where his evidence incriminated
the leading spirits of the Conspiracy, who were
sentenced to long imprisonment, the Molly
Maguires passing thereafter into the history of
evils that had been.</p>

<h2><abbr title="7">VII</abbr><br />

<small>MAJOR ANDRÉ</small></h2>


<p>When the psychology of the Spy comes to be
expounded by some master thinker, one wonders
if he will emphasise the fact that, more often than
not, there is that in the pedigree and antecedents
of the agent of stealth which clearly suggests a
mongrel breed. Was it not Tacitus who wrote
of the half-caste races who swarmed the Roman
Suburra, describing them in the memorable words:
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Despectissima pars servientium</span>"—the most
despicable of the slave tribe? It was among
this class that Marcus Crassus was wont to go in
quest of recruits for that grand army of touts,
quidnuncs and informers who, by bringing him
first-hand intelligence of fires, burglaries, murders
and kindred daily occurrences in Rome, most of
which were pregnant with the possibilities of
profit of some sort, helped to build up the monster
fortune that made him one of the most important
men of antiquity. Your Stiebers and Schulmeisters,
too, all in some vague way convey an
impression that they are beings who are not quite
human, although not wholly brute; living things
which seem to come from an unracial stock without
stamp or tradition. To a man who has
been accorded the honour of a monument in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Westminster Abbey these reflections do not, of
course, apply. Nevertheless they suggest themselves,
and when one reads in the life of John André
that "it was not known whether the place of his
birth was London or elsewhere in England," one
feels disposed not to care particularly whether or
not he ever had a father, or if his mother ever
changed her name. André, too, was by origin a
Swiss, and there is invariably lacking in the inhabitants
of Switzerland a specific national cachet
or clear racial type. His sire had been born in
Geneva, while his mother was a Frenchwoman
called Girardot, who in 1751 gave birth to the
unfortunate British spy.</p>

<p>To add to the complexities of André's particular
case, no one seems to be very certain where he
passed the early years of his education, though it
seems correct that the best part of his academic
training was obtained in that always very cosmopolitan
University of Geneva. We are assured
that there he mastered several European tongues,
that he became an adept in the social arts and
possessed an acquaintance with the best classical
literatures. It is only, however, in 1769, the
year of his father's death, that we really begin to
locate him, and then we find him living at Clapton,
where his father, a merchant, resided in the local
manor-house. At the time of this gentleman's
death, André was eighteen years of age and his
precociousness seems to be established by the
fact that in those days he was paying his addresses
to the daughter of a clergyman named Seward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the lady being several years older than himself.
Not only that, but Anna Seward was, it appears,
a poet and the leader of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> of sorts at Lichfield,
where many well-known literary lights of the day
were wont to assemble and discuss the trends of
literary and artistic thought and action. Evidently
Miss Seward did not take her gallant
too seriously, for we hear of him shortly afterwards
as a worshipper at the shrine of Honoria
Sneyd, who was afterwards to become the mother
of Maria Edgeworth. Romance, it is certain,
entered generously into the youth of André.</p>

<p>It is clear also that the counting-house of a
London merchant's establishment was not at all
to the taste of the young man. He had always
thirsted for military adventure, and it is not surprising
to hear that in his twentieth year, he
purchased a commission as under-lieutenant in
the Royal English Fusiliers. It may be noted
in passing that this was a period in which commissions
in the Army—since become an easy
enough achievement—were practically the monopoly
of men who were far superior by birth
and social position to the sons of even the most
princely merchants, and there is nothing to indicate
that André's father was at all a man of
more than moderate means. The point is interesting,
however, inasmuch as it points to the
psychological tendencies of the young man's
mind. His commission duly obtained, André
repaired at once to Berlin, where he received
considerable insight into the military arts. Berlin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>it may be parenthetically observed, was in those
days probably the best-organised centre of a vast
system of spies, for had not the collector of the
famous giant-regiment of Potsdam Guards passed
that way a generation before, and was not
Frederick the Great still boasting that he had only
one cook and a hundred spies? Some authorities
incline to the belief that young André, while in
Berlin, was already an active spy of the British
Government. It is clear at any rate that when
after a few years' residence in Germany he returned
to England, he became known to prominent
officers as a man not only more than
usually well informed on all matters of a military
kind, but also as a soldier who had fitted
himself by very special study for the business of
probing the military secrets and plans of other
countries.</p>

<p>To the man's personality justice must, however,
be done, for it is agreed on all hands that a more
captivating or picturesque officer had never worn
King George's uniform. Unlike Wolfe, also a
man of literary parts, though a somewhat dark
and silent person, André was a conversationalist
of such fascination and sparkle that his presence
in a drawing-room proved sufficient to attract
the larger portion of both sexes to its immediate
vicinity. Even his male contemporaries
all declare that a more lovable being had rarely
crossed the social stage, while the number of
women of note and fashion with whom the young
officer was said to be on that footing which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>French so expressively describe by the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
mieux</i>, can hardly have been inferior to that which
favoured handsome John Churchill in a former
age. Great facial beauty, a splendid presence,
romantic courage, a reputation for brilliancy in an
age which was far from being a superficial one—all
these were qualities which we expect in the
pages of fiction, but which are only occasionally
to be met with in actual experience. They are
qualities, nevertheless, which have been the
possession of most of the distinguished adventurers
of history and it is obviously the consciousness
of possessing such gifts that turns
your born adventurer towards a life to which he
has no definite social or traditional right.</p>

<p>It is often pointed out in the way of evidence
of André's particular mission as a spy having been
officially forecast for him, that on leaving England
for Quebec, where his regiment was stationed,
the young officer travelled thither by the very
roundabout route via Philadelphia. Here he
arrived in September 1774. His experience as
a man who had seen much of the military spy
system of Frederick and who was in any case
an acute observer of all things were facts of
which General Carleton, the Governor-General of
Canada, was well aware. That officer, coincidently
enough, left England about the same time
as André, the twain travelling however by different
ways. It is assumed, by Americans generally,
that Carleton, who foresaw the imminence
of the Revolutionary conflict, had directed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
subordinate to visit Philadelphia in the capacity
of a commissioned spy, in order to learn all he
might regarding the condition of public affairs,
the temper of the people and, above all, to obtain
some clear idea as to the intentions of the leaders
of the American forces. Halting a short while and
for the accomplishment of his purpose in the old
Quaker City, André subsequently passed to New
York and Boston, ever observant, everywhere
transcribing, always on the alert. At Quebec he
arrived early in November 1774. On the outbreak
of the war André was one of the first British officers
to be captured by the enemy and for over a year
remained a prisoner in several Pennsylvania
cities, where his charming personality and accomplishments
gave him among the enemy the footing
of a privileged guest rather than a captive. He was
exchanged at the close of 1776 and rejoined the
Army at New York, then commanded by Howe.
To that officer André came like some visitor from
Fortune herself, for during his late captivity,
in the course of which he held practically <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte
blanche</i> to move about the outlying country, the
young soldier had always done so with his professional
instincts set and with the result that he
was able immediately to present Howe with more
accurate information as to the military effective,
disposition and plans of Washington than the
regular Intelligence service could have procured
him in three years. A vacancy falling due
on the staff of General Grey, Howe procured
its reversion to André, giving him the rank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Captain. At this time the British Army was
moving on Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Literature dealing with the story of Philadelphia
in that age presents us with the picture
of a city of perennial pageant. The British Army
was in occupation in the winter and spring of
1778 and revelry ran long and high in every phase
of the social life of Quaker City. Our André was
here in his very element and among the acquaintances
he formed was that of Margaret Shippen,
who afterwards became the wife of Benedict
Arnold. "No one," wrote Mr Winthropp
Sergeant in 1861, "seems to have created such a
pleasing impression or to have been so long admiringly
remembered as André. His name in
our own days lingers on the lips of every aged
woman whose youth had seen her a belle in the
royal lines.... He is described as of five feet
nine inches in height and of singularly handsome
person—well made, slender, graceful and very
active, a dark complexion with a serious and
somewhat tender expression; his manners easy
and insinuating.... If the serious business of
life was a part of his lot, there was yet ample scope
for the exercise of those elegant arts in which he
excelled. His infirmities, if any there were, sprang
like Charles Townshend's from a noble cause—that
lust of fame which is the instinct of all great souls;
and his comely person, his winning speech, his
graceful manners procured him universal acceptance,
while his freedom from the grosser passions
of his fellows was especially observed." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
universal gaiety which prevailed throughout
Philadelphia was not without its effect on the
Army as a whole and the inevitable demoralisation
of all classes of society followed. It remains
a lasting tribute to the attractions of the fair
maids of Philadelphia that the number of irregular
marriages which took place among the lower ranks
of the Army alone was so large as to necessitate
the organisation of special pickets with the object
of preventing the wholesale depletion of regiments
through long absence or desertion. As
Benjamin Franklin declared at the time: "Howe
has not taken Philadelphia, Philadelphia has taken
Howe," and it is written that on the evacuation
of the city by the British forces, 18,000
strong, at least 1000 privates deserted, returning
to their sweethearts and lately married wives in
Quaker Town. General Howe himself proved far
from a shining example to his subordinates or
soldiery, indolence and sensuality being his chief
characteristics, while there were not wanting those
who accused him of malversation of military
funds. "He returned to England richer in money
than laurels," while Americans are wont to thank
him for having given them America, as they put
it. His relations with André hardly seem consistent
with what we know of that officer's usual
discernment. In his honour, André, now a major,
had composed and stage-managed a kind of
allegorical tourney entitled the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mischianza</i>, which
was enacted to honour a general who was already
under sentence of recall to England. Howe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in due course succeeded by Sir Henry Clinton, to
whom André, on the departure of General Grey
in 1778, became chief aide and secretary, a position
in which he so clearly proved his ability that
in 1779 he was appointed deputy adjutant-general
to the British forces in America with headquarters
in New York.</p>

<p>We have seen that during his earlier stay in
Philadelphia the young officer had formed a close
friendship with Margaret Shippen, daughter of a
wealthy resident. By 1779 this lady had become
the wife of Benedict Arnold, one of the leading
Revolutionary generals who was appointed
military governor of Philadelphia on its evacuation
by the British. Arnold, it was well known,
maintained a sumptuous style of living which was
wholly out of keeping with his means or position.
A princely retinue, a lavish table, extravagance in
all things were sufficient, once the British ascendancy
had given way to the staid Quaker rule and
custom of Philadelphia, to make him an object
of distrust among a naturally suspicious community.
Nor was Arnold at all a man of high
character, whether domestic or public. Already
in 1780 he was formally accused of peculation
and, though exonerated on inquiry, was reprimanded
by Washington for "imprudent and
improper conduct." Arnold, who fully expected
a complete vindication by his superiors, never
forgave them the last implied stigma on his character.
He was suspected even then of disloyal
conversation with the enemy under adopted names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and his present wrath was not calculated to weaken
any predisposition he may have felt towards the
commission of an act of supreme treachery. It
seems clear that André, an unusually astute judge
of character, had fully taken the measure of
Arnold and perhaps had already learned something
when, on 16th August 1779, he wrote to the
General's wife at Philadelphia a rather whimsical
letter offering to do some "shopping" for her in
New York—a somewhat inconsequent kind of
offer if its object was not to discover the condition
of the lady's purse. Shortly afterwards a
communication was addressed from the Tory side—the
Whigs were the Revolutionaries—sounding
Arnold and his general disposition, and it is now
well established that the correspondence, which
ensued thereafter between Clinton and himself,
partook of a treasonable character on the part of
the American General, who wrote in a disguised
hand and assumed the name of "Gustavus" for
the purpose of his communications, Clinton not
then being aware of the identity or the importance
of his correspondent. It seems clear, however,
that André, as Clinton's secretary, was well aware
of that identity and we may suppose the Major
to have suggested the transference to himself of
the duty of keeping up communication with the
traitor, a transference which accordingly took
place. Major André continued therefore to keep
in touch with Arnold, himself writing under the
name "John Anderson" in a slightly disguised
hand. It is not implausibly maintained by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that in the "shopping" letter which André had
addressed to Mrs Arnold in August 1779 he had
used a disguised handwriting with the object of
making clear to her husband—reasonably certain
to see the letter—the identity of John Anderson.
Shortly after André had taken a hand in the intrigue,
Arnold began to importune his superiors
to give him the command of West Point near
New York, urging the costliness of keeping up his
position in Philadelphia. The request seemed
reasonable and was granted by Washington,
Arnold assuming the command at West Point,
already, it is certain, resolved to surrender that
strong fort to the British who were lying some
fifty miles below in New York, and for whom the
possession of the Point meant a free communication
with Canada.</p>

<p>Up till the contemplated treachery of Arnold,
the ascendancy of the British had been well maintained
on the American Continent. Charleston
had fallen and here André had twice risked his
life disguised as a spy; the South was in British
possession; Gates had been beaten at Camden
and Manhattan was in their army's occupation.
Arnold astutely chose the proper moment for his
act of treachery, certain in that dark hour to
produce a strong moral reaction upon the Revolutionaries.
In September 1780 the American
General forwarded to André a letter asking for a
personal interview within the American lines, the
Major to disguise himself as John Anderson.
André refused to enter the danger zone and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
meeting was arranged to take place at Haverstraw—neutral
ground—on 21st September. Thereafter
it became a matter of somewhat dangerous
rumour that André, whose daring men well knew,
was about to undertake a perilous enterprise, a
successful execution of which must swiftly end
the war. A baronetcy, a brigadiership, a large
sum of money—these were the rewards Clinton
is said to have promised his young Adjutant. It
is generally agreed that André faced his present
mission with anything but that imperturbability
which had marked his departure on similar expeditions.
He was saddened, it was said, by an
indefinable presentiment of death and impending
disaster, and left New York to keep his appointment
with Arnold, sailing up the Hudson in the
British sloop <i>Vulture</i>. Arnold had agreed to send
a boat to the sloop at midnight, 21st September,
in order to take off the Major, who, on his landing,
was led by a friend of the former to the
secret tryst on neutral ground. The interview
was long, Arnold haggling desperately over the
terms of settlement; dawn had already begun to
shadow the eastern hill-tops and still the bargain
was not square. By five o'clock, however, the
men had come to terms, and Arnold, who had
horses in waiting, suggested the completion of the
details in documentary form at the house of a
local farmer, Smith his name. André consented
reluctantly, well knowing the house in question to
be within the American lines. By ten o'clock the
deeds were drawn up and signed; André was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
possession of all necessary information concerning
the post to be surrendered. Arnold was to make
a show of resistance on the arrival of the British
on 25th September, while Washington himself
was to be delivered into the hands of the enemy
on his return that way on September 27th.
Benedict Arnold was to receive some £6500 as
a reward for his treachery, a sum which was
eventually paid though the surrender of West
Point never took place.</p>

<p>On leaving Smith's residence and bidding adieu
to Arnold, the Major discovered to his surprise
that the <i>Vulture</i> had disappeared. The sloop
had been cannonaded during the night and compelled
to drop down the river. As the Major
considered his difficult position, the vessel returned
to its previous moorings and André requested
Smith to convey him aboard. Smith
refused, pleading reasonably enough that he was
afraid of the consequences to himself of rendering
such a service. No bribe being sufficient apparently
to move the farmer, André found himself
forced to remain where he was and to his undoubted
peril, until nightfall. Smith offered to
provide the Major with an American uniform, but
finding it impossible to procure one, gave him
instead an old-fashioned coat of the cavalier style,
purple in colour, with faded gold lace. A melancholy
beaver hat completed the strange attire of
the British officer who covered the whole with an
ordinary surtout. Contrary to express instructions
from Clinton, André took away the papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which Arnold had given him at the farmhouse, concealing
them in his top-boots—an entirely senseless
as well as purposeless proceeding, which
eventually led to his undoing. Accompanied by
Smith and a negro, André crossed the Hudson at
King's Ferry on 22nd September, rode boldly into
the American lines, spending, indeed, a night at
another farmhouse in the midst of the enemy.
On the 23rd, bidding his companions adieu, the
Major, following directions given him by Smith,
made for so-called neutral ground which swarmed
with Tories and where he might feel reasonably
safe. Mistaking a turn, however, in the old
Tarrytown Road, along which he rode his horse
slowly and with some hesitation, he came suddenly
upon a group of farmers who were ranging
the countryside in quest of suspicious persons.
One of them, Paulding by name, wore a Hessian
surtout given him by a friend. When André
came in sight the company was playing cards, and
on the Major's approach, Paulding, the master
spirit of the gang, stepped to the front, musket
in hand, commanding the traveller to halt and
account for himself. Seeing the Hessian coat—a
garment peculiar to King George's troops—André
stopped his horse.</p>

<p>"My lads," he said, "you belong to our side, I
see."</p>

<p>"What side?" asked Paulding.</p>

<p>"The British side," André replied.</p>

<p>"We do," answered Paulding.</p>

<p>André was momentarily taken off his guard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "I am a British
officer out on particular business. I am glad to
be among friends once more and I hope you will
not detain me."</p>

<p>"We are Americans," cried Paulding, "and
you are our prisoner."</p>

<p>Assuming as much composure as he could, André
drew Arnold's passports from his pocket permitting
"Mr John Anderson to pass the guards
to the White Plains," only, of course, to confirm
the suspicions of the farmers, who thereupon
dragged him from his horse, searching him from
head to foot, duly to find the incriminating documents
which clearly proved their captive a first-class
spy. The Major began by offering them in
turn, cash, his gold watch, one hundred guineas,
and finally made a promise of one thousand
guineas, saying he would remain a hostage in their
hands till one of the party should return with the
money. "We would not let you go for ten
thousand guineas," shouted Paulding, and André's
doom was spoken. He was taken to the nearest
American post and delivered to the commandant,
Colonel Jameson, under his name John Anderson.
André at once requested that General Arnold
should be notified that his friend "Anderson"
was in custody, and the Colonel, an unsuspicious
soul, concluded that he could best serve his superior
officer by returning the captive to Arnold, under
a guard of four troopers in charge of Lieutenant
Allen, who was also entrusted with a letter in which
the Colonel mentioned that he was "forwarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
certain documents found on Anderson forthwith to
Washington," and this was accordingly done.
André, to his joy, set out with his escort on the
return journey to Arnold's lines. Before the
party had progressed many miles towards West
Point, a messenger arrived with orders for their
return, and André found himself a captive once
more in Jameson's lines, the Colonel, on a subordinate's
advice, having decided to refer the whole
matter to General Washington. In the meanwhile
Allen, of his own initiative, had proceeded
to Arnold's headquarters with the private letter
and report from Jameson to the commander at
West Point. For this blunder your true American
has never forgiven the simple-minded Colonel.</p>

<p>On 24th September, the day following his
capture, Major André, of whose real name and
rank the American officers were still ignorant,
indited his famous letter to Washington, full of
rhetoric and self-justification, in which he advanced
several considerations for his release from
captivity. Mentioning his name and military rank,
he only wrote, he said, to vindicate his good fame,
not to solicit security. He was not, he vowed with
a strange distortion of actuality, accustomed to
duplicity. He justified his negotiations with
"a person" (Arnold, unnamed) who was to give
him intelligence which should prove serviceable
to British arms, a fair ruse of war, he thought.
Having concluded these negotiations, he proceeded,
he was conducted without his knowledge
into the American lines. He had thus become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
prisoner and was justified in his endeavour to
escape by all means available, and having reached
neutral ground, through a disguise, he had been
arrested by irregulars. There were gentlemen
at Charleston, he concluded, in a half-menacing
and highly impolitic phrase, whose rank might
be set in exchange for his; in any case they were
persons whom the treatment he received could
not fail to affect. Washington received this
communication after the flight of Arnold who,
learning from Jameson's letter, duly delivered by
Allen, how perilously matters stood for him, had
taken refuge on board the British vessel <i>Vulture</i>.
The American commander-in-chief gave immediate
orders for the transfer of André to West Point,
where he arrived on 26th September, under the
care of a strong escort commanded by Major
Tallmadge, the officer who had advised Jameson
to countermand the first order sending the
prisoner to Arnold. It was to Tallmadge that
André made the memorable confession that he
had engaged in the adventure "for military glory,
the applause of his King and country and perhaps
a brigadiership." The Major asked the American
in what light General Washington was likely to
regard him.</p>

<p>"He will regard you," replied Tallmadge
simply, "just as the British regarded my old
comrade and schoolfellow, Nathan Hale. Your
fate will be the same as Hale's."</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand the fierce indignation
of the Americans at this critical time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when the black treachery of a commander on their
own side is considered, and it was, from the very
first, written in the stars that André should receive
no mercy, although, indeed, a strong effort
was made to exchange him for Arnold whom,
in all probability, the Americans would have
preferred. In General Washington, above all,
there was an elemental severity of the early
Roman type which would leave nothing to chance,
although the plot had, happily for his own arms,
totally miscarried. Nevertheless, with that ideal
sense of justice which was found later in his
illustrious successor, Lincoln, he convened a
military board with the object of making careful
inquiries and reporting their "opinion of the light
in which the prisoner ought to be considered and
what punishment ought to be inflicted." The
court consisted of six major-generals and eight
brigadier-generals. It was held at Tappan, where
Washington had his headquarters. Inevitably
André was held to be "a spy from the enemy and
only death could satisfy his crime." Washington
stood by the verdict and sentenced Major André
to be hanged as a spy on the second day of
October at four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At four accordingly on the second day of October
1780, Major André was executed upon an eminence
near Tappan village, in the presence of a vast
concourse of people. He was dressed in full
military costume and white top-boots. A large
procession of officers preceded him to the gallows—a
cross-piece between two trees. The prisoner's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
step was firm nor did he falter until he saw the
gallows, realising then that, despite his appeal to
Washington, he was to die as a felon and not as
a soldier. His hesitation was only momentary,
however. A baggage-wagon, in which was laid
a plain pine coffin, had been driven under the
gallows, a grave being dug near by. Into this
wagon the prisoner stepped, and taking the rope
from the hangman adjusted it to his neck, tying
also a white silk handkerchief over his eyes. The
Major was then told that he might speak if he
wished. Lifting the fold lightly from his eyes
and bowing courteously, André replied in a firm
voice: "All I request of you, gentlemen, is that
while I acknowledge the propriety of my sentence,
you will bear me witness that I die like a brave
man." And taking his last look at the sky, he
replaced the bandage on his eyes. The wagon
was driven swiftly from under him, and in a few
minutes he was no more.</p>

<small>BRITISH SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>


<p>Under the euphemism Secret Service, we describe
in England our system of espionage. In common
with other countries, espionage has always prevailed
in England as essential in some degree to
most conditions of our political, social, diplomatic
and commercial life, all of which are conducted on
the most comprehensive and complex lines. The
story of England has, however, revealed but little
of the spy in any class and, indeed, next to nothing
at all when considered in proportion to the vastness
of its national and international relations
and commitments, a happy state of affairs which
is attributable to the fact that our constitutional
liberties represent the nearest approach to the
ideal in respect of the completeness of their
guarantees. Going back to early periods, it is
only in the case of prominent figures like Alfred—who
did his own spying, it will be remembered—or
the seventh Henry, or Wolsey, that we find
there was anything like the beginnings of an
organised secret service system. The father of
King Harry, through the agency of his lawyers
Empson and Dudley, undoubtedly spied out the
financial conditions of the territorial nobles as
well as the monastic properties, and by doing so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
certainly facilitated the seizure of the Abbey
possessions when the Reformation took place in
the next reign. The agents employed in the case
of the wealthy landowners were usually chaplains
who also exercised secretarial functions for their
patrons, while in the monasteries renegade monks
were always to be found willing at a price to put
Henry's financial sleuths in the way of obtaining
correct information. The Lord Cardinal, there
is no doubt, spied on the goings and comings of
Campeggio when that legate was in England,
and neither is there any doubt of his having spied
successfully, and much to the irritation of the
monarch, on King Henry himself who retaliated,
however, more than once by informing the
Chancellor as to certain romantic but very unpriestly
trysts of the Cardinal which had come
within the royal cognisance. In royal circles, of
course, we may be sure that spying has always
been the custom, all the more so since household
officers justify their persistent attentions on the
ground that the safety of the royal person requires
that it should be perennially shadowed. Did not
Fouché once surprise Napoleon, who was boasting
of the superiority of service rendered by his own
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espions</i>, when he informed the Emperor
regarding every detail of a nocturnal outing which
Majesty had made through Paris in company
with Murat, and in the course of which visits were
paid, in turn, to a low music-hall, a lower night-house
and a cheap restaurant?</p>

<p>To find the first definite shapings of organised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
secret service we must come to the time of
Elizabeth when the Intelligencer and the Spy
were well-known characters in the society of the
period. The Intelligencer proves highly interesting
as a study of the purely parasitical life.
In general, he started in life as a man who made
it his business to learn what was going on at all
the main centres of public and private life, trading
off the items to men of business, politicians and
diplomatists for the best price he could obtain.
He corresponded very closely to the Roman
quidnunc with whom the Satires of Horace made
us all familiar in our schooldays. Who can forget
the picture of that oily Nasidienus—what a nose
for news the name holds!—whose chief title to
dine with Mæcenas depended on the fact that he
constituted in his own person a kind of central
news agency upon which all the gossip and intelligence
of Rome was sure to converge. For
indeed, the famous quidnunc had his own corps
of reporters whom he employed to scour the City
in quest of tittle-tattle for his patron. The Intelligencer
or private newsmonger of Elizabeth's
age was, it is recorded, looked upon as a highly
respectable member of the workaday classes
until, to use a journalistic Americanism, he began
to "put it over" on his patrons—meaning to
say, when he began to supply them with the news
that was not, drawing good money in exchange
for false intelligence. Like the free-lance of our
own day, the Intelligencer had first of all to build
up a connection, as the phrase goes, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
being remunerative, or the reverse, in proportion
to the man's energy and reliability. Since in
those days he invariably dealt with principals,
it happened not so seldom that he effected a
permanent way into the good graces of a wealthy
patron, rising afterwards to positions of honourable
importance. It is, nevertheless, a fact that
the majority of these men deteriorated, and for
the simple reason that, deeply versed as they
became in the sordid architectonics of life of all
kinds, social, political and commercial, they
quickly shed their ideals. Their previous experience
and knowledge of ways and means had,
however, fitted them in a peculiar manner for the
business of watching other men and they were
invariably sought out by personages of wealth
and position to exercise the trade of spy, or
common informer. And, accordingly, when
Burleigh and his congeners were looking around
for plausible excuses for killing off Mary of
Scotland, they fell back on the services of an
informer who had originally made his bow before
the public as an Intelligencer. It is not necessary
to go into the story of the mysterious "J. B.,"
whom one Delbena, an Italian adventurer, had
introduced to the English Ambassador in Paris,
Poulet, as a man of good birth, but desperate in
all enterprises and a traitor to the last fibre of his
spinal column. The records of Elizabethan days
would seem to indicate either that Burleigh and
Walsingham were not very astute judges of the
common spy, or else that "J. B." was devilishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
apt in extracting large sums out of credulous
statesmen and diplomats, for it is written that
having raised many thousands from Poulet on
his simple promise to capture an agent of Mary
Stuart, whose papers were certain to incriminate
that Queen—why, the rascal failed to deliver
goods, to use another expressive newspaper
Americanism. Then there was the informer
Gifford whose early training as a priest enabled
him, in his clerical capacity and with forged
credentials, to spy on the great Catholic families
of his time, in all cases transmitting false yet incriminating
information to Burleigh. His nefarious
activities brought at least a dozen men to
the execution block in those days. In two years
another of the species, one Thomas Phillips,
also an ex-Intelligencer, had contracted to the
Crown a debt equal to the large sum of £60,000
of our own money on account of infamous
work done for its ministers, mostly political, be
it said. Indeed, the record of the Elizabethan
spy constitutes one long chronicle of the bloodiest
treachery in the whole history of secret service,
since the Tower, if not Tyburn, invariably figured
as the last scene in the life of the unfortunate
who fell into the hands of the Queen's sleuths.
Treachery seems, for all the halo which surrounds
our notion of the "good old days," to have
played a part in the whole social fabric as universal
as it was sinister, nor can the fact be wondered
at, seeing that the promiscuous distribution of
the confiscated estates of murdered men, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
often in a day rewarded poor men with vast lands,
was an ever-present incentive to the cupidity of
the adventurer.</p>

<p>Cromwell, if we may judge by diaries and records
of his day, was the best-informed man in England.
He had an undoubted faith in the value of secret
service and was ably served by the many agents
he employed, not only at home, but also abroad,
where their activities helped to lay the broad
foundations of that foreign policy which is based
upon the principle known as the Balance of Power.
It was the Protector's custom to invite to his
table men whom he well knew to be what the
current vernacular of the time termed "trimmers"
and what the American calls a "mugwump";
these men he invariably surprised with the correctness
of his information regarding the variety of
their political friends and relations, as well as of
the dangerous company which they frequented,
advising them always in a friendly way to beware.
The Protector was one of the few statesmen in
Europe who remained a perennial puzzle to
Mazarin, during whose large ascendancy on the
Continent, Cromwell strengthened the foundations
of that naval power which has given England
for so long a paramount voice in Europe's councils.
His successor Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> distinguished himself
above all other English monarchs by receiving
into his intimate court circle a paid spy of Louis
<abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> in the person of Louise de Kérouaille, on
whom he conferred the title of Duchess of Portsmouth.
This lady, as Duchesse d'Aubigny in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>France, was at the same time drawing a ducal
revenue from the coffers of Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV.</abbr>, while
it remains a matter of statistical record that in
the year 1681 she took in perquisite from the
English Exchequer the sum of £136,000—equal
to more than half-a-million sterling of our time.
There can be little doubt that the capacity for
political intrigue of the Duchess, as well as her
complete ascendancy over Charles and her own
greed of money, contributed at a later stage
to swell the indictment which ultimately led
to the banishment of the Stuarts. In her Life
of the Duchess, Mrs Colquhoun Grant takes a
view generally accepted by historical writers, to
wit, that the favourite's character was neither
vicious nor depraved, that her conduct was not
immoral according to the notions of the age,
that she was a woman of immense political
capacity, while of a tender and affectionate heart.
Her political correspondence, in which she exercised
her specific rôle as informer to the French
court, was carried on with Madame de Montespan,
who is memorable as one of the splendid favourites
of Louis.</p>

<div class="caption smcap">The Duchess of Portsmouth

</div>

<p>Passing over to Georgian times we find that the
employment of spies was common in all departments
of life, and there can be little doubt that the
Hanoverians brought to England many men and
women who had learned the arts of espionage at
the best of all possible schools—namely, Berlin.
The history of England of those days shows us
nothing in the way of pre-eminent exponents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the business, nor can espionage be said, in its
political aspects, to have reached to that excellence
of organisation which it attained later in the times
of Pitt, whom the ever-present activities of Bonaparte
compelled in the interests of our security
to develop a secret-service system the operations
of which were inferior to none in Europe. It
remains a matter of record that in the days of
the French Revolution certain political leaders
in England were in the pay of the Committee
of Public Safety presided over by Robespierre.
This fact was communicated to Pitt through his
own spy, a professedly violent Jacobin, who by
means of cipher and anagrammatic correspondence,
carried on with a relative in Italy, was
transmitting by that roundabout route the most
minute and accurate accounts of the Committee's
proceedings to the English Premier. The sums
paid for such dangerous work, while never, of
course, disclosed, were undoubtedly very large,
seeing that the all-observant Saint-Just was
moving at the time through Revolutionary circles.
The failure of the French invasion of Ireland in
December 1796 is also set down to an act of paid
treachery on the part of the captain of one of the
French vessels, the story being that he took
advantage of prevailing foul weather to decline
approaching the Irish coast for several days, and
since the general commanding the expedition
was on board, the brave venture became a foregone
failure. Charles Lever, who, it will be remembered,
acted as British Consul at Spezzia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Trieste, introduces us on more than one occasion
to a kind of consular or ambassadorial spy, an
individual who in those days was as regular a
member of a chancellery as its archivist is in our
own.</p>

<p>In the time of Napoleon, Charles James Fox,
an admirer and friend of the First Consul, found
himself, all unconsciously, caught in the vast
woof of the Fouché-Talleyrand system of intelligence,
thus becoming an unwitting agent in communicating
to the French Government certain of
the designs of the British Government for the
destruction of Bonaparte's Continental policy.
The fact that Fox was a desperate gambler, and
ever in debt, was not of course allowed to escape
the notice of his few, but bitter, enemies, who in
this case were obviously moved by malice rather
than by anything they really knew. The cleverness
of Canning in procuring private information
regarding the secret clauses of the Treaty of
Tilsit between Alexander of Russia and Napoleon
is commonly regarded as among the greatest
achievements of diplomacy in all time. How
the British foreign minister obtained this information
will probably remain a secret for ever;
but the momentous results of his cleverness are
indisputable, since they led to the seizure of the
Danish fleet and broke up the northern confederation
of powers by which Napoleon still hoped to
invade England, and some analogy to which is
found at our own time in the occupation of
Belgium by the Germans, England having been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
main objective in both cases. Conjecture is, of
course, not wanting as to the means which placed
this intelligence in the hands of Canning. According
to one writer, a certain Lady Sarah Spencer,
in a letter addressed to her father at Althorp,
declared at the time that "Lord G. L. Gower had
got possession, for £20,000, of the original treaty
of Tilsit and that one of the secret articles stipulated
that the Danish fleet should be employed
against us, which induced Ministers to adopt such
measures." It is declared by a member of the
Mackenzie clan that one Colin Mackenzie, who
perfectly understood and spoke French, disguised
himself as a Cossack and was one of the attendants
chosen to accompany the Russian Emperor to the
raft on which the interview with Napoleon was
held—a story which does not, it must be said,
meet with very cordial acceptance. Again it is
asserted that the famous Launay, Count d'Antraigues,
obtained the treaty from a friend in
Russia, a version which seems disproved by the
fact that the Count was at that time in disgrace
in England. On Sir Robert Wilson has also been
conferred the distinction of discovering the secret
understandings of Tilsit, while the tradition of
the Foreign Office is that the information came
indirectly from the Emperor Alexander and was
given publicity through some blunder on the part
of the Russian Ambassador in London—most
probably the correct facts.</p>

<p>The enactment of the Union between England
and Ireland led in its time to the commission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
untold treacheries. Until within a score of years
ago there stood in the private offices of Dublin
Castle two iron-clamped chests filled to the top
with papers relating to pre-Union days. These
chests bore the Government seal and on them was
inscribed the legend: "Secret and confidential—not
to be opened." For close upon a century,
these chests remained unexplored until, leave
having been given for their examination, hundreds
of betrayals and treacheries leapt to light. Men
of the highest names, says Dr Fitzpatrick, in
effect, were found to have been spies of the
Government and practically <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i>,
although to the outer world they bore themselves
as high-souled patriots of unimpeachable honour.
The various causes in which these men served
were not less filled with the foulness of secret crime
than outwardly they proved to be fraught with
deliberately constructed outrage and injustice to
a whole nation. Coming down to more modern
days, we seize upon the story of Major Le Caron.
This man's adventure among the open and admitted
enemies of England shows us the meagre
extent to which our Government is prepared to
subsidise its agents abroad. Le Caron is not
singular in his criticism of the British authorities
who, by a consistent policy of paying starvation
pay, have reduced the secret service to the proportions
of a vanishing quantity. Le Caron
warned the authorities of their fatal and improvident
parsimony in his time. "Some day,"
he said, "a big thing will happen about which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
there will be no leakage beforehand and then the
affrighted and indignant British citizen will turn
on his band of thirty secret-service men and rant
and rave at them for their want of capacity and
performance. The fault will be the want of a
perfect system of secret service, properly financed.
If plots are to be discovered in time, they can only
be discovered through information coming from
men associated with them. If it is to be made
worth their while to speak, then the price offered
by the British Government must be higher than
that of the other paymasters." Le Caron's words
are clearly based on the assumption that men
enter into revolutionary movements rather for
what there is in them, than from any spiritual
or ethical motives. Until far more evidence than
we possess is afforded us, we fear that the spy
must be held to be right, for the tortuous path of
political agitation is a path which is ever crowded
with self-seekers and one on which the altruist
is always the loneliest of pilgrims.</p>

<p>In the course of the trials of Captains Trench
and Brandon at Leipsic in 1910, the public
prosecutor emphasised his view that British gold
had bought up the services of hundreds of agents
scattered throughout Germany, all of them engaged
in the business of transmitting important
information to the British Admiralty and War
Office. Visitors to what is known as the Black
Country of Westphalia will recollect, too, how
ordinary English tourists who arrive at towns in
the neighbourhood of Essen, the home of Krupp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
such as Bochum, or Wesel, or Elberfeld invariably
become the objects of police attention from the
moment of their arrival at local hotels. It is
certain that espionage on the part of the foreigner
excites more real concern in Germany than is the
case in England, a fact that we must put down
to her geographical position which leaves her,
despite vast armaments and preparations, an ever-possible
object of attack to heavily armed nations
which surround her on all sides. Even, however,
if it be the fact that England has held her spies
within Germany itself, few will be found to argue
that it is not a legitimate use of secret service
funds, as well as a matter altogether apart from
the infamy which attaches to the person who
accepts money in return for the betrayal of fatherland.
It is, nevertheless, very questionable if
any information really worth having, in the
military sense, ever escapes the record of duly
appointed military attachés, whose official existence
dates from 1864 and whose admitted business
it is to keep themselves professionally posted as
to the resources of a possible enemy. In regard
to Germany, it may be said that in the business
of spying, she occupies a class by herself, since
professional espionage is not looked upon by the
people as in any way degrading or underhand.
An easy tolerance of this kind towards a trade
which is in itself intrinsically base cannot, it must
follow, be without a corresponding reaction on
the common mind in regard to spying for the
benefit of foreign powers, and we may reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
assume it to be the fact that in such cases
the British authorities go far less frequently in
quest of native spies, than the native spies come
in quest of British gold. A sum of less than
£40,000 is annually set aside for the purposes of
the British Secret Service, according to official
books. The smallness of the sum must clearly
be some index of the limits of our secret-service
operations, although no one is asked to suppose
that the amount in question covers the entire
expenditure made on account of useful information
given up. Germany, it is known, makes
a public appropriation of, roughly, £1,000,000
sterling for the secret-service system. Russia's
budget for the same object amounts to £500,000,
while that of France is less than £200,000, as
far, in all cases, as public figures are available.
The public appropriations do not, of course, reveal
anything like the entire sums expended, the facts
as to which could be realised only by a survey
of the various accounts of consular offices and
embassies throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Much ink has been spilt and many public
utterances have been made with the object of
showing that the British Government had taken
but perfunctory measures in order to fight the
system of espionage which was preparing England
for invasion, even as France had been prepared
for invasion in 1870. Writers in the daily Press
and members of Parliament had declared, by the
end of August 1914, that anything more inadequate
than the British system of what is known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
counter-espionage—that is to say, the organising
of spies to watch and report on Germans who
were obviously overrunning the country in quest
of information of military value—was inconceivable.
After all, results afford the best test of
the precautions taken, and it is on record that
the ease and rapidity with which the authorities
rounded up over 14,000 German and Austrian
potential spies, within a few weeks of the outbreak
of the war, came as an illuminating shock
to the German Secret Service authorities themselves
who had based their warlike decisions
largely upon the hypothesis that England was
still asleep. A well-known authority on such
matters at the Home Office informed the writer
in September 1914 that even the so-called "incendiary
points"—that is to say, localities which
had been marked out as suitable for the setting
fire to houses, in the event of aerial raids on
London—were being gradually and completely
scheduled by vigilant officers of our Secret Service,
and in such a way that nothing was left to assist
the operations of possible spies who have succeeded
in eluding enumeration by our somewhat
silent and unofficious, but nevertheless eternally
wakeful police. As we have said in another
place, the German organisation of spies, internal
and external, had been raised to a point under
Stieber, beyond which, given the present conditions
of the world and mankind, it was practically
impossible to go, and since for the past
twenty years and more, we have been in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the technical details of Stieberism, we may rely
on it that the authorities, on their side, have not
read in vain. Shortly after the outbreak of the
Great War, and in order to allay the anxiety
created by critics of such departments as are
charged with the duty of watching the enemy in
our midst, the Home Office issued the following
statement dealing with measures which had been
undertaken with a view to counteracting the
operations of foreign spies scattered throughout
the Islands:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In view of the anxiety naturally felt by the
public with regard to the system of espionage on
which Germany has placed so much reliance, and
to which attention has been directed by recent
reports from the seat of war, it may be well to
state briefly the steps which the Home Office,
acting on behalf of the Admiralty and War Office,
has taken to deal with the matter in this country.
The secrecy which it has hitherto been desirable
in the public interest to observe on certain points
cannot any longer be maintained, owing to the
evidence which it is necessary to produce in cases
against spies that are now pending.</p>

<p>"It was clearly ascertained five or six years
ago that the Germans were making great efforts
to establish a system of espionage in this country,
and in order to trace and thwart these efforts a
Special Intelligence Department was established
by the Admiralty and the War Office which has
ever since acted in the closest co-operation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>the Home Office and Metropolitan Police and the
principal provincial Police Forces. In 1911, by
the passing of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, the
law with regard to espionage, which had hitherto
been confused and defective, was put on a clear
basis and extended so as to embrace every
possible mode of obtaining and conveying to
the enemy information which might be useful
in war.</p>

<p>"The Special Intelligence Department, supported
by all the means which could be placed
at its disposal by the Home Secretary, was able
in three years, from 1911 to 1914, to discover
the ramifications of the German secret service
in England. In spite of enormous efforts and
lavish expenditure of money by the enemy, little
valuable information passed into their hands.
The agents, of whose identity knowledge was
obtained by the Special Intelligence Department,
were watched and shadowed without in general
taking any hostile action or allowing them to
know that their movements were watched. When,
however, any actual step was taken to convey
plans or documents of importance from this
country to Germany the spy was arrested, and in
such case evidence sufficient to secure his conviction
was usually found in his possession.
Proceedings under the Official Secrets Acts were
taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and
in six cases sentences were passed varying from
eighteen months to six years' penal servitude.
At the same time steps were taken to mark down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>and keep under observation all the agents known
to be engaged in this traffic, so that when any
necessity arose the Police might lay hands on them
at once, and accordingly on August 4, before the
declaration of war, instructions were given by the
Home Secretary for the arrest of twenty known
spies, and all were arrested. This figure does
not cover a large number (upwards of two hundred)
who were noted as under suspicion or to be kept
under special observation. The great majority
of these were interned at or soon after the declaration
of war.</p>

<p>"None of the men arrested in pursuance of the
orders issued on August 4 has yet been brought
to trial, partly because the officers whose evidence
would have been required were engaged in urgent
duties in the early days of the war, but mainly
because the prosecution, by disclosing the means
adopted to track out the spies and prove their
guilt, would have hampered the Intelligence Department
in its further efforts. They were, and
still are, held as prisoners under the powers given
to the Secretary of State by the Aliens Restriction
Act. One of them, however, who established a
claim to British nationality, has now been formally
charged, and, the reasons for delay no longer
existing, it is a matter for consideration whether
the same course should now be taken with regard
to some of the other known spies.</p>

<p>"Although this action taken on August 4 is
believed to have broken up the spy organisation
which had been established before the war, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>still necessary to take the most rigorous measures
to prevent the establishment of any fresh organisation
and to deal with individual spies who
might previously have been working in this country
outside the organisation, or who might be sent
here under the guise of neutrals after the declaration
of war. In carrying this out the Home
Office and War Office have now the assistance
of the Cable Censorship, and also of the Postal
Censorship, which, established originally to deal
with correspondence with Germany and Austria,
has been gradually extended (as the necessary staff
could be obtained) so as to cover communications
with those neutral countries through which correspondence
might readily pass to Germany or
Austria. The censorship has been extremely
effective in stopping secret communications by
cable or letter with the enemy; but, as its existence
was necessarily known to them, it has not,
except in a few instances, produced materials for
the detection of espionage.</p>

<p>"On August 5 the Aliens Restriction Act was
passed, and within an hour of its passing an Order-in-Council
was made which gave the Home Office
and the Police stringent powers to deal with aliens,
and especially enemy aliens, who under this Act
could be stopped from entering or leaving the
United Kingdom, and were prohibited while
residing in this country from having in their
possession any wireless or signalling apparatus
of any kind, or any carrier or homing pigeons.
Under this Order all those districts where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Admiralty or War Office considered it undesirable
that enemy aliens should reside have been cleared
by the Police of Germans and Austrians, with the
exception of a few persons, chiefly women and
children, whose character and antecedents are
such that the local Chief Constable, in whose
discretion the matter is vested by the Order,
considered that all ground for suspicion was precluded.
At the same time the Post Office, acting
under the powers given them by the Wireless
Telegraphy Acts, dismantled all private wireless
stations; and they established a special system
of wireless detection by which any station actually
used for the transmission of messages from this
country could be discovered. The Police have co-operated
successfully in this matter with the Post
Office.</p>

<p>"New and still more stringent powers for
dealing with espionage were given by the Defence
of the Realm Act, which was passed by the Home
Secretary through the House of Commons and
received the Royal Assent on August 8. Orders-in-Council
have been made under this Act which
prohibit, in the widest terms, any attempt on the
part either of aliens or of British subjects to
communicate any information which 'is calculated
to be or might be directly or indirectly useful to
an enemy'; and any person offending against
this prohibition is liable to be tried by court
martial and sentenced to penal servitude for life.
The effect of these Orders is to make espionage
a military offence. Power is given both to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>police and to the military authorities to arrest
without a warrant any person whose behaviour
is such as to give rise to suspicion, and any person
so arrested by the police would be handed over
to the military authorities for trial by court
martial. Only in the event of the military
authorities holding that there is no prima facie
case of espionage or any other offence triable by
military law is a prisoner handed back to the
civil authorities to consider whether he should be
charged with failing to register or with any other
offence under the Aliens Restriction Act.</p>

<p>"The present position is, therefore, that espionage
has been made by statute a military offence
triable by court martial. If tried under the
Defence of the Realm Act, the maximum punishment
is penal servitude for life; but if dealt with
outside that Act as a war crime the punishment
of death can be inflicted.</p>

<p>"At the present moment one case is pending in
which a person charged with attempting to convey
information to the enemy is now awaiting his trial
by court martial, but in no other case has any
clear trace been discovered of any attempt to
convey information to the enemy, and there is
good reason to believe that the spy organisation
crushed at the outbreak of the war has not been
re-established.</p>

<p>"How completely that system had been suppressed
in the early days of the war is clear from
the fact—disclosed in a German Army Order—that
on August 21 the German Military Commanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>were still ignorant of the despatch and
movements of the British Expeditionary Force,
although these had been known for many days
to a large number of people in this country.</p>

<p>"The fact, however, of this initial success does
not prevent the possibility of fresh attempts at
espionage being made, and there is no relaxation
in the efforts of the Intelligence Department and
of the Police to watch and detect any attempts
in this direction. In carrying out their duties,
the military and police authorities would expect
that persons having information of cases of suspected
espionage would communicate the grounds
of the suspicion to local military authority or to
the local police, who are in direct communication
with the Special Intelligence Department,
instead of causing unnecessary public alarm, and
possibly giving warning to the spies by public
speeches and letters to the Press. In cases in
which the Director of Public Prosecutions has
appealed to the authors of such letters and
speeches to supply him with the evidence upon
which their statements were founded in order that
he might consider the question of prosecuting the
offender, no evidence of any value has as yet been
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Among other measures which have been taken
has been the registration, by Order of the Secretary
of State, made under the Defence of the
Realm Act, of all persons keeping carrier or homing
pigeons. The importation and the conveyance
by rail of these birds have been prohibited; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>with the valuable assistance of the National
Homing Union, a system of registration has been
extended to the whole of the United Kingdom,
and measures have been taken which it is believed
will be effective to prevent the possibility of any
birds being kept in this country which would fly
to the Continent.</p>

<p>"Another matter which has engaged the closest
attention of the police has been the possibility of
conspiracies to commit outrage. No trace whatever
has been discovered of any such conspiracy,
and no outrage of any sort has yet been committed
by any alien—not even telegraph-wires
having been maliciously cut since the beginning
of the war. Nevertheless, it has been necessary
to bear in mind the possibility that such a secret
conspiracy might exist or might be formed among
alien enemies resident in this country.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, immediately after the commencement
of hostilities, rigorous search was made by
the police in the houses of Germans and Austrians,
in their clubs and in all places where they were
likely to resort. In a few cases individuals were
found who were in possession of a gun or pistol
which they had not declared, and in one or two
cases there were small collections of ancient firearms,
and in such cases the offenders have been
prosecuted and punished; but no store of effective
arms—still less any bombs or instruments of destruction—have
so far been discovered.</p>

<p>"From the beginning, any Germans or
Austrians who were deemed by the police to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>likely to be dangerous were apprehended, handed
over to the military authorities, and detained as
prisoners of war; and, as soon as the military
authorities desired it, general action was taken to
arrest and hand over to military custody Germans
of military age, subject to exceptions which have
properly been made on grounds of policy. About
9000 Germans and Austrians of military age have
been so arrested, and are held as prisoners of
war in detention camps, and among them are
included those who are regarded by the police as
likely in any possible event to take part in any
outbreak of disorder or incendiarism."</p></div>

<small>FRENCH SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>


<p>Napoleon it was who once expressed the view
that if not impossible, it was rare to find a Frenchman
who could really put his heart into the
business of spying, whether military or civil, and
it was his custom, as far as possible, to employ
in either capacity men of that cosmopolitan or
unnational type of which we have spoken. The
Emperor's view would hardly seem, however, to
fit in with the preconceived notion entertained
by most of us. Regaled as we have long been
with the fantasies and fictions of modern French
writers and their inspired master detectives, we
find ourselves almost invariably crediting the
French system of secret service with being, in
respect of its excellence, an exemplar to all other
kindred bodies. No satire, so far as we know,
of the stolen-white-elephant type has ever yet
been written with the object of pointing out the
futility of its processes or the imbecility of its
methods, and in any case, it is a matter of
statistical record that the amount of undiscovered
crime in France is twenty per cent. lower than
that of any other country in the world. Here, it
must be admitted, we seem to be confusing the
business of the detector of crime with that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
secret-service agent; in most countries, nevertheless,
the two departments work largely in
conjunction, and it may be, in general, fairly
presumed that a service which is likely to provide
a good corps of detectives is also capable of
producing an able body of spies. It would seem
that in no age in French history was the system
of organised spying so complete as during the
ascendancy of Richelieu, when clerical influences,
supported by a vast network of espionage, were
everywhere overwhelming, and again during the
times of Napoleon's military empire, a contrast
in conditions which suggests the idea that governments
which are based on autocratic or non-representative
principles invariably require the
help of intrinsically corrupt and vicious influences
to enable them to maintain their existence. For
all the lauded excellence of the imperial German
organisation of spies, that of France may be said,
when we take into consideration the lighter
political and social machinery of a Republican
country, to be hardly less comprehensive, as well
as quite as effective in its results.</p>

<p>Paris is, of course, the centre of the French
organisation. Here it works craftily and silently
and though rarely coming into contact with the
work of the President or his Cabinet, is permanently
in touch with departmental officials in all
the great public offices. It is declared on the
authority of a now-retired divisional chief of
the French secret service, Saint-Just, that even the
Prefect of Police in Paris only rarely hears of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
business details of his own department, though
it is very doubtful if such a statement could be
made about M. Méline, whose omnivorous activities
and private information during his tenure of that
office are said on more than one occasion to have
extricated the Republic from a difficult international
impasse. As a rule the divisional chiefs
of the system only invite the attention of the
titular head of the service in the event of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause
célèbre</i> in which great names are mentioned, or
else in cases in which international complications,
as in the Dreyfus drama, are to be feared. The
French Secretary for Foreign Affairs can alone be
said, in regard to the work and the results of the
French spy system, to be in close touch with it;
and in all certainty this was true about M. Delcassé
in the perilous period of the Moroccan
imbroglio of 1906. Other Ministers, all of whom,
like the Prefect of Police himself, hold office by
virtue of their being party men, know as a rule
less about what is taking place in the underground
of political movements than much humbler civil
servants. The divisional chiefs without doubt
are the real controllers of the police organisation;
these men are practically irremovable and they
are invariably so well acquainted with inside
working of state affairs that no Government dares
dismiss one of them without grave reason. Colonel
Henry, whose momentous knowledge of the real
motives which underlay the Dreyfus affair made
his own removal by suicide or murder—who can
tell which?—an insistent necessity, had acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as a go-between from a divisional chief to an
important political personage in France and consequently
learned, in the course of his dealings
with them both, that formidable secret which
eventually cost the Colonel his life.</p>

<p>The spy system of France is largely based nowadays,
as in the time of Fouché, on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dossier</i>.
In France any person who has had, or even who
is likely to have, anything like a career which
is of a public nature is duly taken cognisance of
by the police, and all and everything in the way
of private information or gossip or documentary
evidence and the like is collated against all possible
eventuality and upshot, the result being forthwith
archived in the offices of the chief of police.
The merest novice who enters in any capacity
into the limelight of publicity, even artists,
literary men, frail queans of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</i>,
financiers, politicians, social fancy-men, jockeys,
actors, clerics, opulent mistresses, editors—all
these in point of personal "pedigree," to cull an
expression from the American police vocabulary,
are better known to the secret service than to
their own parents. And so it happens, when a
man attains to high political power and is courted
by ministers, he invariably makes it his business
to become as intimate as possible with the Chief
of the Police, his object being to recover and
destroy all incriminating documents concerning
his past life. In former times, we have all read,
kings were wont on occasion to ask useful retainers
if they had anything to solicit in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
favours. If a French President were nowadays
to invite a rising or, better still, a risen politician
who had served the party well, to make his particular
request, it is certain that first, and before
all things, the politician would ask to be put in
possession of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossier</i>, since no man, great or
small, cares that the world should know by what
arts he taught himself to rise, as Pope puts it.
It is an undoubted fact that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossier</i> is frequently
asked for by arrivals at high political
position, and the police, of course, make a pretence
at surrendering it. But do not think for a moment
that they actually surrender each and all of the
documentary proofs and tit-bits of private intelligence
which have come into their possession
regarding the person most concerned. The great
man is, of course, given a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossier</i> of sorts. Yet a
year or so later, when the politician has fallen
from his high office, the "pedigree" is replaced
in the police archives, often fatter and more succulent
than ever. Since the days of Fouché,
who was the inventor of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossier secret</i>, this
has been a fixed official custom of the French
Police and the cost of its maintenance is charged
on the municipal rates. It is also certain that
no constant visitor to Paris, no matter whence
he comes or what his nationality, provided he
possesses high political or social importance, or
even notoriety, in his own country, all unconsciously
goes through the ordeal of having his
pedigree taken, as they say in New York. And
again, since the art of police photography has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
become common, as often as not, and unknown
to himself, the visitor has to submit to the official
process of having his portrait taken, or being
"mugged," as the American police so expressively
describe it.</p>

<p>Years back, in the time of Napoleon the Third,
there existed a system of spying throughout
France, known as that of the "White Blouses,"
these being a ubiquitous band of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i>
who were paid to incite the people to riots
and so furnish the police with pretexts for incarcerating
leading popular spirits who were likely,
if allowed their freedom, to become dangerous
to the stability of the Empire. The fall of that
fabric in 1870 led to the partial break-up of this
monstrous organisation, and many who were known
to be its paid agents were very deservedly shot
in the days of the Commune. After the establishment
of the Republic the spy police was reorganised
and a special brigade of secret-service
agents was formed whose object was—and still
is—to spy upon all those political sects at the
head of which stand pretenders like the Duke of
Orleans, or Prince Napoleon, or the late General
Boulanger. At any grave political crisis in
France these political sects display more than their
usual energies, trusting more or less, as they do,
in the star of their particular candidate, and at
such times the corps of spies become correspondingly
active. This especial body is said to have
constituted far more than any other force to the
permanent stability of the present Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
regime. Most of its special spies are recruited,
it is known, among the newspaper reporters and
writers of Paris and the larger towns of France,
and for the reason that their business affords them
better opportunities than are given to most men
of coming in touch with people who are anxious
to "move the public mind" in regard to pet
principles, or in simpler words, who have an axe
to grind. This service was the invention of the
celebrated Prefect of Police Andrieux, who also
organised a system of fractional divisions of his
police which still exists, and which is also associated
with the body that spies upon the movements
of anarchist societies in France, Spain,
England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Belgium,
Holland and the United States, with all the chief
bureaux of which countries it continues to remain
in permanent affiliation. Its magnificent work
undoubtedly accounts for the chronic failure of
the militant anarchists to do serious damage or
outrage in anything like proportion to the fiery
sentiments which they profess to entertain towards
all reasoned systems of government, or
even in proportion to their numbers.</p>

<p>The real chief of the French Secret Service is,
as we have told, not the Prefect of Police, who
is a politician and a party man. The traditions
of a generation will it that the active headship of
that service be taken over generally by the chief
of what is officially known as the Third Division
of the Police. Under this functionary's control
are the head of the First Bureau in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossiers</i> are kept, and the head of the Second
Bureau which deals with the reports of political
agents and which also directs the notorious Black
Cabinet having charge of the opening of all
private letters passing between suspected persons;
when read these letters are photographed and
archived. The Third Bureau has been made
famous in recent times by the Panama, Dreyfus
and Humbert scandals in which its large corps
of handwriting experts and interpreters came
on the scene. In the First Division the various
bureaux are made up as follows: (<i>A</i>) Spies upon
persons of note; thus Esterhazy during the
Dreyfus case had seventeen members of this
division following him in all places and at all
hours. (<i>B</i>) The corps of men who are detailed
to watch women frequently visited by prominent
politicians, and who are, when it is found necessary,
instructed to "engage the sentiments" of
the ladies at their dwelling places, cash-expenses
being allowed the spies in proportion to the
cubicular tariff of any given lady who may be
suspected of knowing anything. (<i>C</i>) The body
of spies who are detailed to spy upon the actions
and movements of notable foreigners. This body
includes those spies who are available for hire
by great bankers, the heads of large business
houses, the chiefs of great newspapers, or any
other private individuals of great wealth and
position who for reasons of their own, wish to
have their employees, their acquaintances, or their
mistresses followed and their movements reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
upon. Foreigners and others whose presence is
not considered desirable in France are invariably
tracked down by the spies of this department.
(<i>D</i>) The service of spies whose qualifications
enable them to look out for traits of insanity or
eccentricity, especially in persons of wealth and
"in the interests of public health and security,"
it is officially stated. There is then the Second
Division, which is composed mainly of a bureau
the agents of which are stationed at the different
ports of France and who watch all suspicious
characters landing in or leaving France, or who,
as occasion requires, visit foreign ports in quest
of criminal evidence; a subsidiary body of its
spies are detailed to watch malefactors and
politicians of the municipal order. Finally there
is the "laboratory" to which the late M. Bertillon,
the anthropometrician, has given celebrity
as chief of its Identification department, in
which criminals are measured or identified. In
this department, should the police be very
anxious to possess the "identification dossier"
of any person who is suspected of criminal relations,
the chiefs have the suspect arrested on some
pretext or other. He is at once haled to the
Identification bureau, where the officials go through
the mock process of recording his measures.
Subsequently it is discovered that, after all, he is
not the person required, and he is released with
much apology. The bureau authorities nevertheless
retain his card and when, if ever, the
suspect is caught in the act, he is sure to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
confronted with his record in measurements even
though he have never so many aliases.</p>

<p>As in Germany, so in France, that type of
inferior spy who is known by the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchard</i>
is generally to be found among the municipal
inspectors of lodging-houses, the supervisors of
night-houses, those detectives whose business is
the watching of the street-police, all of which individuals
have opportunities for picking up clues
to more or less important crime. There is also
an inferior corps of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchards</i> who are known
by the expressive term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remueurs de casseroles</i>—that
is to say, persons whose business it is to stir
up the social saucepan in any district in order to
bring minor details to light. As may be supposed
from their name, they move in the very lowest
circles of the unchosen races of evil and are
generally to be hired, for a franc or two the job,
among waiters, money-lenders' touts, race-course
"narks" and such gentry. Spies are also, it is
well known, sent in the guise of convicted offenders
among those already undergoing imprisonment,
with the object of bringing to the knowledge of
the police further details as to crimes already
committed. Such a person is usually known
among French professional criminals by the name
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouton</i>." All these classes of spies may be
said to come under the supervision of the chief of
the Third Division, who also takes charge of that
portion of the system which is detailed to watch
the mining, the manufacturing and the wine districts
for the purposes of reporting on anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the way of "syndicalist" disaffection. The
political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espionnage</i> in France numbers,
it may be said, some 1000 paid agents of all
grades of society, men and women. They are
expected to earn their living among the class of
people upon whom they report to the police, so
that being in regular employment their movements
shall not be open to suspicion. When the
chief-of-division requires the service of a particular
spy at an established point, the individual
chosen is requested formally to present himself
at district headquarters. Here he is informed by
the presiding chief that some details have been
gathered concerning his relations with a dishonest
and punishable piece of business which had taken
place perhaps ten years before in, perhaps, another
neighbourhood, or even a different town. The
visitor admits the fact, but pleads that the occurrence
is really statute-barred. The police official
declares himself ready to forget the matter provided
his visitor will consent to work on his behalf
among the people of his factory, or store, or municipality,
as the case may be. There will be a
little money in it—according to the man's standing,
and all he is required to do is to forward once or
twice weekly a letter detailing conversations,
opinions expressed by others, various acts, trysts
and so on of any or all of those with whom he
works and consorts. The prospective spy does
not know, nor will he ever know, what object the
police have ultimately in view, or how important
it is, or for what stakes they are playing. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in reality on the outside rim of some gigantic
movement the penetration of the inmost workings
of which is being sought. Naturally he consents
and enters the public service as an "agent of
record."</p>

<p>In France, it is well established, each great
newspaper has a spy who is in receipt of occasional
tips from the proprietor. His duty is to watch
editors, writers and reporters, their movements,
the quality of the people they visit and how they
spend their spare hours. These newspapers also
employ their agents in other offices in order that
items of special interest in the way of news shall
not be omitted by their own papers. In the
great banking-houses of Paris there are spies paid
from inside to spy upon employees and spies paid
from outside to spy on the especial details of the
business, its investments, its intentions and plans,
and even these men are spied upon in their turn
to prevent their abusing their information on
the Bourse. Politicians, senators—all these are
watched by colleagues who draw salaries from
the secret-service funds. Going back many
years, it will be recalled that at a critical moment
in his political career, General Boulanger fled
from Paris because, as he explained to the reporters
in Brussels, his enemies had decided upon his
seizure and imprisonment. It was afterwards
shown that the General's valet, one Georget, was
a paid spy in the service of the police, and
Boulanger had taken him to Brussels. Furthermore,
the maid who waited upon Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Bonnemain, Boulanger's mistress, was the sweetheart
of Georget, and she also was a paid police spy,
the result being that the movements of both were
perfectly well known to the secret-service agents,
who could have arrested the General at any one
of the twenty stations between Paris and Brussels.
The police were fully aware, indeed, as Boulanger
himself was, that, his cause being discredited, he
no longer counted in politics or society.</p>

<p>The French War Office is now as well informed
as any war office in Europe and the war of 1914
may be held to have disproved the opposite view.
Into its secret intelligence bureau flows information
from every part of Europe. The military
attaché of the present day is responsible for much
that is pigeon-holed in its offices—services of
transportation, war material, armaments, railroads,
mobilisation plans, finances—and there is
little of moment in any other country upon which
French emissaries cannot throw all necessary
light in the way of special information. From the
General Staff down every military official collects
his quota. He is trained what to observe, what
to ask about, what to look for and what to expect—plans
of fortifications, new guns, or parts of
guns and so forth. Accordingly it is not surprising
to hear that France, which had neglected
to watch, or who more probably despised the
internal enemy in 1870, had by 1914 perfected a
system of counter-espionage which totally neutralised
that of Germany in all directions. Since
1895 the French Code has been increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
practically only one item of importance in regard
to spies. The clause in question states that "all
dealings with the enemy, by private French
citizens, which shall have the effect of conveying
knowledge that hostile armies can make use of in
war shall entail penal servitude for life. In the
case of officers or officials who are found to be
transmitting information to the enemy the penalty
shall be death."</p>

<p>Renan has declared that, to the honour of
France, it has ever been found impossible to discover
a traitor in her hour of trial. On the whole
this statement may be taken as representing the
truth, and in flagrant cases in which French citizens
have been proved to have betrayed their country,
it has almost invariably been proved that the
offenders were of German origin.</p>

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>


<p>In order properly and fully to understand the
nature of the German system of spying, it is
essential that we go down to fundamentals. The
principles on which it is based may be said to
have their roots in the character of the Germans
themselves and that character has been largely
developed by a special type of ethical education,
the lines of which were to a great extent conceived
by Frederick the Great as especially applicable to
the qualities of his people, and subsequently
elaborated into a kind of national philosophy by
writers like Nietzsche, Treitschke, Bernhardi and
others, all of whom were the leaders of that
extreme pragmatical school of which we have
spoken. Frederick, it may be said, was like his
descendant<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> of to-day, William the Second, a man
who outwardly professed religious principles and
held the view that Religion is absolutely necessary
in a State government. In the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Matinées
du Roi de Prusse</i>, published in 1784, the Prussian
monarch is made, however, to say that the value
of religion for the people consists mainly in the
fact that it enables their rulers to hold them more
completely in subjection. For a King to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>any religion whatsoever is, he is also said to have
declared, a very unwise policy, and for the reason,
he adds, that "if a King fears God, or more exactly,
if he fears a future punishment, he becomes a
greater bigot than any monk. If a favourable
opportunity presents itself of taking forcible possession
of a neighbouring province, immediately
an army of demons seems to him ready to defend
it; he is weak-minded enough to think he
is going to commit an injustice and he proportions
the punishment of his crime to the extent
of his evil designs. When he is about to conclude
a treaty with some foreign power, all is lost if he
stops to remember that he is a Christian, for by
doing so, he will always suffer himself to be duped
and imposed upon."</p>

<p>It is only right to state here that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Matinées</i>
have been disavowed as the work of Frederick
himself, and in the British Museum catalogue
are placed among the "doubtful and spurious"
works relating to the King of Prussia. It may be
pointed out, however, that the "Testament of
Peter the Great" was also in its time disavowed,
although the policies it lays down for the Russianisation
of the Near East have always been followed
to the letter by successive Tsars. It is certain,
too, that the successors of Frederick the Great on
the Prussian throne have followed in every sense
the spirit of their ancestor's alleged teachings
and counsels, as far as indicated by the work
under consideration, and since the policies in regard
to the conduct of war and government, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>were counselled as far back as 1784, are to-day
being followed and improved upon by German
commanders, we make no apology for assuming
that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Matinées</i> fully represent the mind
of the monarch to whom they are attributed.
As regards war, for example, here is the alleged
opinion of Frederick:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_fp_162"></a>
<img src="images/i_fp_162.jpg" width="400" height="589" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center smcap">Frederick the Great</p>

<p class="center">The founder of modern organised espionage</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>"War is a business in which the slightest scruple
is detrimental to one's arms and policies. It may
be said that no sovereign can seriously enter into
the business of war, if he feels he has not the right
to justify pillage, incendiarism and carnage," a
declaration which allows us to assume that at least
<em>one</em> Hohenzollern heart would never have bled for
the fate of Louvain, or Arras, or Rheims, in 1914.</p>

<p>Continuing to voice his opinions on religion,
the King is made to say: "Whatever we may
think inwardly, impiety is never to be displayed
at any time, although we must adapt our sentiments
and opinions to our rank and standing in
the world. It would be the height of folly, if a
monarch's attention was diverted by trifles of
religion which are fit only for the common people.
Besides, the most complete indifference for religious
matters is the best means which a King
can hold to prevent his subjects from becoming
fanatics. My ancestors acted in a most sensible
manner in dealing with religion, undertaking a
religious Reformation which, while it gave them
a glorious apostolic halo, at the same time filled
their treasuries with money. The Hohenzollerns
began by being pagans, of course, but became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Christians in the ninth century in order to
please the Emperors; in the fifteenth century they
became Lutherans in order to have an excuse
to rob the Church, and Reformers again in the
sixteenth, in order to placate the Dutch over the
succession of Cleves."</p>

<p>In regard to Justice, Frederick declared that
justice is due to the subjects of a State, although
it is especially necessary that rulers should not
be brought so far within the scope of justice that
they become themselves subject to it. "I am
too ambitious and autocratic by nature to suffer
willingly the existence of another order within
my States which should restrict my action. It
was for this reason that I drew up a new code of
laws. I am fully aware that I did away with
the real spirit of justice, but the truth was, I had
become rather afraid of the influence such notions
exert among the common people. A King must
not allow himself to be dazzled by the word
Justice: it is only a relative term, and one which
is susceptible of application and explanation in
different ways. Everyone likes to be just in his
own fashion, and as I early realised this, I decided
to undermine the foundations of that great power
Justice. And so it has only been by simplifying
it as much as possible that I have been able to
reduce it to the point where I wanted it to be—that
is, to a minimum. I could never have accomplished
anything had I been restrained by legal
ideals. I might have passed for a just monarch,
but I should never have won the title of a hero."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the value of a set policy in the world and
as the only means of achieving any success,
Frederick had very decided notions: "As it has
been agreed among men that to cheat our fellow-creatures
is a base and criminal act, it has been
necessary to find a word which should modify
the conception, and accordingly the term <em>policy</em>
was adopted. By the word policy, I mean that
we must always try to dupe other people. This
is the only sure means of getting, not necessarily
an advantage, but a fair chance of remaining on
an equal footing. I am, therefore, not ashamed
of making alliances from which only myself can
derive entire advantage; but I am never so foolish
as not to break faith when my interests require
it, since I uphold the rectitude of the maxim
that to despoil one's neighbours is to deprive them
of the means of injuring one. Statesmanship can
be reduced to three principles or maxims: the
first is to maintain your power and, according to
circumstances, to increase and extend it, just as I
doubled my army on reaching the throne for the
sole purposes of conquest. Make sure of your
army; have plenty of money and bide a favourable
time; you can then be certain, not only of
preserving your States, but of adding to them.
The term 'balance of power' is one which has
subjugated the whole world; in reality, however,
it is nothing but a mere phrase. Europe is a
family in which there are too many bad brothers
and relatives, and it is only by despising the whole
system that vast projects can be formed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
second principle is to make your allies serve you,
and to throw them off when they have ceased to
be useful. The third principle is to make yourself
feared—this is the height of great statesmanship.
All your neighbours must be led to believe that
you are a dangerous monarch who is moved by
no principle except martial glory. If they are
convinced that you would rather lose two
kingdoms than not occupy a prominent place in
history, you are certain to succeed. Above all,
let no one within your kingdom write anything
except to extol your actions and efforts."</p>

<p>Given a political philosophy of this kind as the
inspiration of the Prussian idea—"Kultur," they
call it—it is not hard to realise that the essentially
evil qualities of the government of Prussia were
certain ultimately to react upon the character of
the people themselves. If anyone should doubt
the correctness of our view that non-constitutional
systems of government invariably require the
support of vicious subsidiary systems in order to
assure their stability, as in the militaristic regime
of Napoleon, or the quasi-ecclesiastical rule of
Richelieu, a study of Prussian autocracy will soon
put him in the way of settled conviction. Since
the day of Frederick, some one hundred and
twenty-eight years ago, the people of Prussia
have only known such liberty as is consistent with
a bureaucracy the underlying conditions of which
are conceived on entirely military ideas—that is
to say, the type of individual freedom which we
are accustomed to associate with a feudalistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
regime or rule by martial law. People who
travelled much on the Continent before the outbreak
of the Great War may recollect how on
crossing the frontier of Belgium into Germany—at
Herbesthal, if we remember—one invariably
seemed to experience much the same sensation as
that of exchanging the atmosphere of some warm
and comfortable sitting-room for the cold and
formal conditions of a public office. Once across
the border, the military spirit seemed to predominate
everywhere, while among the friendly
enough natives of the unofficial classes there was
a subdued not to say cowed demeanour which
was in saddening contrast with the free-and-easy
cheeriness of the people just left behind. Everywhere
was there evidence of set discipline and on
all hands the spectre of officialism appeared to
darken the daily lives of men with some sort of
unexpressed threat. Even fair and open dealings
seemed among the townsmen to be undertaken
with the consciousness that at any moment some
furtive official might come upon the scene and
utter the irrevocable <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verboten</i>—forbidden. Later
in the noisy gaieties of the beer-garden or music-hall,
one ever seemed to note that fear of the
boisterous schoolboy who under the watchful eye
of a forbidding master never ceases even in the
fullness of his frolic to wonder just how far he is
allowed to go. "Germany," says the admirable
Price Collier, "has shown us that the short-cut
to the government of a people by suppression
and strangulation results in a dreary development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>of mediocrity." In our opinion the
American might have added that a nation which
is ruled as if it were a country of convicts, actual
or potential, cannot fail inevitably to develop in
a pronounced degree those symptoms of character
and predisposition which land your convict
in the correctional institutions where he is most
commonly to be found. "Prussia and Germany,"
again says Collier, "are still ruled socially and
politically by a small group of, roughly, fifty
thousand men, eight thousand of them in the
frock-coat of the civilian official and the rest in
military uniforms."</p>

<p>It is the fashion to say that Doctor Stieber
was the organiser of the modern spy system of
Germany, for the conduct of which some million
pounds sterling are annually appropriated. The
truth is, however, that the organisation goes
much farther back, a well-known statesman of
the Napoleonic period, Baron Stein, having been
responsible for the practical application of the
theories which lie implicit in the philosophy of
Frederick the Great. In his turn, Stieber assumed
control of the lines and developed them to a point
at which improvement became almost impossible.
Stieber was a typical adventurer of the middle
class, a man who, it is clear enough, had in him
all those elements of character which we associate
with the criminal who operates along the higher
lines. It is said that he qualified as a barrister,
not so much with the object of practising law, as
to discover its limitations, or in other words, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
know for a certainty how far scheming and the
exploitation of simpler natures can be made a
lawful trade. He was born in Prussia in 1818,
and having been called to the Prussian Bar, sought
to apply his knowledge of legal matters as a kind
of counsellor in a Silesian factory, Silesia being in
those days, 1847, the nursery of that vast school
of Socialism which has since gained over twenty
millions of adherents throughout Germany—indeed,
one-third of the empire's entire population.
By far the larger percentage of the workmen
attached to the factory at which he was employed
were Socialists, and Stieber realised that if he
could only penetrate the secrets and methods of
this important socialistic nucleus, he might prove
undoubtedly serviceable to the central government
in Berlin. Accordingly he joined the
Socialist brotherhood, professing to be entirely
in sympathy with their aims and aspirations, and
in a short while became an acknowledged leader
of the Silesian movement. As a man of superior
education, Stieber gained admittance to the family
of the firm which employed him, won the heart
of his employer's daughter and married her.</p>

<p>It is certain that by 1848 he was already in
touch with officials at the chief police bureau in
Berlin, and traitor that he was, in order further
to ingratiate himself with the Berlin authorities,
Stieber persuaded his wife's uncle to enter into
the Socialistic movement, the new recruit compromising
himself so deeply by the violence of
his radical opinions and utterances that, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Stieber's complicity, he was denounced, arrested
and imprisoned on the ground that he was inciting
the Silesians to revolt against the government.
To have been a Socialist about 1850 was,
it may be said, as bad as to have been an Anarchist
in the last years of the nineteenth century, when
that movement was at its height. The arrest of
a relative through Stieber's instrumentality was
accordingly a real earnest of his good disposition
towards existing authority, and it was readily
realised that in this recruit there was all the baseness
and treachery which Berlin looked for in its
officials. Stieber was summoned to Berlin, where
he was given a commission in the secret police,
with the duty of allying himself to the Socialist
movement and reporting as to its progress, designs
and machinations to headquarters in
Berlin. Parenthetically, it may be observed, the
German word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">stieber</i> is equivalent to our own term
sleuth-hound, so that the spy was happy in his
patronymic as well as mentally adapted for his
traitorous trade. A writer has described him in
the following terms:—"Herr Stieber is a man
whose head, nose and ears suggest a Hebrew
strain, although it is known that his father was a
Gentile. There is in the general aspect of the
face, and especially in the drawn lines of the
mouth, much of that self-justifying hardness
which is associated with the ideas given us of the
Inquisition Fathers; his eyes are almost white
in their colourlessness. With subordinates he
adopts the loud airs of a master towards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
slaves, and when in the presence of high authorities
he is self-abasing and quiet of voice, wearing
a smile of perennial oiliness and acquiescence,
with much rubbing of the hands, a Jewish characteristic."</p>

<p>His work in Silesia was so ably performed and so
many arrests and imprisonments followed as the
result of his services, that the Berlin authorities
decided to employ their sleuth in the capital, where
already the Socialists were becoming an important
enough body. Armed with letters of introduction
from his committees in Silesia, Stieber arrived in
Berlin and forthwith became a member of the
principal revolutionary clubs in the metropolis.
The spy himself describes his presentation to
King Frederick William: "My duties required
me as a Socialist leader to head a procession of
revolutionaries through the capital. At a point
in the progress of our bands, the King appeared
on the scene, and naturally felt but little at his
ease, seeing that the Socialists were the avowed
enemies of all existing forms of government and
their representatives. Noting his trepidation, I
approached his majesty near enough to say:
'Sire, have no fear. I am of your majesty's side
and have taken every precaution for your safety.
In the meanwhile I must proceed with my rôle of
leading these poor deluded people.'" Notwithstanding
that Stieber from this day became an
object of suspicion to men of the Socialist clubs
who had known him in Silesia, the influence of
the King protected him and eventually took him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
into the monarch's service with the title of "police-counsellor,"
a position which allowed him virtually
to act on his own initiative and independently
of the minister of police. Stieber's real business
in his new post was to keep a close watch upon
the ministerial or official police, and that he did
so with particular satisfaction to the Prussian
monarch, the latter one day admitted to the official
chief of police who was complaining of the officious
activities and energies of the police-counsellor,
and suggested his removal on the ground that
since the man was a traitor to those with whom
he professed to adhere, he must necessarily be
suspect in any cause in which he engaged. The
King replied:</p>

<p>"Stieber is more devoted to his King than to
any cause and I reward him well. He used to
come to me from time to time and tell me what
the Socialists were doing, what their plans and
intentions were and how on one occasion they
had debated the question of seizing the royal
family and establishing a Commune."</p>

<p>The minister of police was accordingly forced
to realise that Stieber had for several years been
engaged in the double game of working for the
secret service as an agent and at the same time
of spying upon them at the instance of the King.
A few days later he was appointed by his royal
patron chief of the Prussian secret service with a
salary of £1200 per annum. In his new capacity,
as the confidential man of the sovereign and the
head of a system which operated almost as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
against the official police as against revolutionary
bodies, the spy had not only to organise the
nucleus of that army corps of espionage which
by 1912 was said to number 45,000 active agents,
but had also to fight strong and influential enemies
who saw with dismay the promotion of this unknown
intruder. In order to effect the complete
independence of his own body from all others
which exercised kindred functions, Stieber suggested
the entire modernisation and specialisation
of his service with proper subsidies and adequate
appropriations from parliament, the department
to enjoy autonomy under its presiding chief.
He undertook himself to organise an "internal"
and an "external" service, and here it may be
said that the Russian dual system of espionage
has been based entirely on Stieber's ideas and, in
so far, differs not at all from the secret service of
Prussia, except possibly in that the almost entire
absence of ideas of personal liberty renders illegal
acts and outrages far more frequent in Russia
than in Germany. It was Stieber also who inaugurated
the well-established system of court-spying
which is known to exist at all the German
capitals; he was responsible for the corps of spies
within government offices who spy upon departmental
bureaux, while a highly efficient body of
clerks who were employed in banking and commercial
houses and all institutions which possessed
large internal and foreign relations were also paid
in proportion to tit-bits of information which they
were able to place at the disposal of his cabinet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
To the King—clearly a worthy descendant of
Frederick <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>—Stieber, by virtue of his office, had
free access and presented a daily report in person
in which all and everything of any import concerning
the public and private life of men and
women was made known to the sovereign. On
one occasion the King jokingly reproved his spy,
saying: "You give me all the information I require
regarding the private lives of my courtiers;
but what about my brothers? They are certainly
not angels."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty had not authorised me to spy
upon the Princes," replied Stieber, "but in the
meantime I had prepared myself against the
possibilities of your Majesty doing so. Here are
three sealed documents containing all there is to
be known about their Royal Highnesses since I
have had the honour of serving."</p>

<p>By 1854 the chief agent had become a personage
in Berlin, and although the nobility of the
higher rank would not receive him, Stieber found
many valuable acquaintances among the wealthy
"climbers" of the capital who were eager to be
associated with the powerful chief confidant of
the King. When the special-service department
was in full running, Stieber was given orders to
apply its methods to foreign countries and accordingly
by 1860 Austria, Bohemia, Saxony, Luxembourg
and France were under the observation of
his employees. In 1855 the Reichstag voted an
appropriation of about £15,000 in order to
"secure for the State the benefits of useful intelligence,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>the secret-service agent himself drawing
some £1800 yearly from the fund. At this
time, says a writer of the period, Stieber was the
most prominent official in the kingdom. All
were conscious of being closely watched by himself
and his agents and everyone was aware that ruin
and dismissal could be brought about at the nod
of the chief, and accordingly Stieber effected the
entrance of himself and his wife into some of
the best houses in Berlin under veiled threats of
disclosing secrets of moment unless his advances
were respectfully received. About this time,
too, Stieber began that collection of decorations
which were to testify to the high honour and
esteem in which his King and country held him.
He had no proper military uniform and that which
on official occasions he was wont to wear resembled
not a little the quasi-regimental garb of the
commissionaire. By 1860 it had become heavily
covered with medals and decorations.</p>

<p>Stieber's activities had enabled him to learn
so much as to the inner workings of the whole
political and social fabric of Prussia and the
Germanic nations that an attempt to abolish the
private police system, undertaken by the Reichstag
in 1855, had no practical result, although
Stieber disappeared for a short while from official
life in that year. It was certain, however, that
the very extent of his private information had
made him a man who was no less dangerous than
important and who, in any case, was an individual
who had to be calculated with. Bismarck, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
already-established figure in national politics, was
the first to realise this in 1864, when he was president
of the council of ministers and when Stieber
was reinstated in active public life. In the
previous couple of years he had occupied his comparative
leisure by organising the Russian secret
police, by discovering the manœuvres and designs
of a certain French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intrigante</i> whose services were
being used by diplomats, the Tsar conferring on
him the order of Stanislaus and making him a
large grant of money. Bismarck was well aware
of the splendid services Stieber had rendered to
Russia and it was with a view to making use of
the chief's universal information that he attached
him to the foreign office as a secret-mission agent,
with instructions to proceed into Bohemia. It
was already Bismarck's intention to strike down
Austria, even as he had struck down Denmark
in 1864 and as again he was to strike down France
in 1870. Stieber's mission was to prepare the
invasion of Bohemia by supplying Bismarck with
all kinds of topographical information which must
prove of the first importance to German military
commanders. It was information which could
only be acquired by a most minute inspection of
the various military routes available into Austria,
and Stieber felt that this could best be accomplished
by disguising himself as a pedlar. His
stock-in-trade consisted of religious statues and
indecent pictures. During 1864, 1865 and 1866,
the supposed pedlar, travelling with a small
wagon, mapped out in the completest detail the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
country through which the Prussian armies
marched in the last-named year to the victory of
Sadowa by which Austria finally surrendered any
possible claim she may still have entertained to
hold the headship of the Germanic States in
Europe. Even Moltke, the Prussian organiser
of victory, was astonished at the vast amount of
valuable military information by which the spy
had facilitated the rapid advance of his armies.
"A man with a genius for military combinations
could not have done better for his own purposes,"
declared the old Field-Marshal to Bismarck.
King William, too, while occupying Brunn as his
headquarters after Sadowa, requested the ex-pedlar
to administer the town, explaining to
both Bismarck and the commander-in-chief his
reasons in the following words:—</p>

<p>"One must not confine oneself to giving money
to spies. One must also know how to show them
honour when they deserve it."</p>

<p>Stieber was Governor of Brunn, the capital of
Moravia, for several months, a position which
Napoleon had also allowed his spy Schulmeister
to hold at several towns in his time. It has to be
remembered, however, that in both cases the spies
were in districts about which they were far better
acquainted than any members of the military or
political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnels</i>. Expediency also counted for
something in each appointment. At the close
of the war he was appointed a Prussian privy-councillor
and minister of the national police.
Asked afterwards how much he had expended on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
his network of strategic spies and traitors who
practically sold Austria to Prussia in 1866, Stieber
replied:</p>

<p>"One cannot set down in dollars the value of
bloodshed which has been avoided, nor of victories
which have been secured."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><abbr title="11">XI</abbr><br />

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>That Stieber was admitted to the more intimate
confidences of Bismarck would seem indicated
by the fact that in the year after Sadowa, the
chief of police suggested, he tells in his Memoirs,
that he should be entrusted with the task of doing
in France what he had done in Bohemia. This
was in June 1867, when he asked Bismarck for
eighteen months' time in which to supply the
Chancellor with all the military and regional
intelligence of the French frontiers and invasion
zones, which it was necessary to possess for a
successful campaign. Prussia was then paying
some £52,000 a year for the secret-intelligence
service, and Bismarck was not slow to perceive
that Stieber in his own way was making the
path of victory more smooth for von Moltke's
commanders. In the month of June the
Chancellor had induced King William to confer
on his police-minister the order of the Red
Eagle, and in the course of the evening which
followed the conferring of that decoration Bismarck
and Stieber were for long engaged in conversation,
the momentous nature of which was soon shown
by the departure of Stieber, accompanied by his
aides, Zernicki and Kaltenbach, into France with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the object of laying down base-lines, as the surveyors
put it. Among the various results of that
journey was the appointment of over 1000 spies
within the invasion zones with "head-centres"
at Brussels, Lausanne and Geneva. Another
result of this journey, he himself tells, was his
handing over to Bismarck some 1650 reports of
fixed local spies, in the pay of Prussia, 90 per cent.
of them Prussians, which called for (<i>a</i>) the drafting
of large bodies of German agriculturists into
districts which lay along the possible routes of
advancing German armies, and (<i>b</i>) the sending
of several thousands of female employees for
service in public places as barmaids or cashiers.
It was emphasised that these women should be
"as pretty as possible." Several hundred retired
non-commissioned officers were to be sent to
France, where local "fixed spies" guaranteed
them employment of a commercial kind. Furthermore
in the garrison towns in the eastern departments
some fifty young and pretty girls to act
as servants in canteens were requisitioned by
Stieber, who laid stress on the fact that women
of a "high type of morality" would hardly serve
his purpose, which was to extract information
from drinking soldiers. Several hundred more
domestic servants were to be placed among the
homes of middle-class people such as doctors,
lawyers, merchants. From the year 1867, and
in pursuance of Stieber's plans, some 13,000
German spies of the minor order were asked
for, itself a sufficiently large body of immigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
one would imagine, to awaken the suspicions of
alert French people. Between that year and
1870, Stieber had added at least 20,000 more, all
of them scattered in various kinds of capacities
along the routes of intended invasion from Berlin
and Belgium to Paris. There was one important
interlude, however.</p>

<p>In 1867 an attempt was made on the life of
Alexander <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> of Russia by a Pole, when that
Emperor was paying an important political visit
to Napoleon <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> Stieber was then in Paris with
Bismarck, also attached to the staff of the King
of Prussia, who was a participator in this meeting
of sovereigns. Information had come to the
Prussian minister of police that an attempt was
to be made on the life of Alexander. Accordingly
Stieber called on Bismarck, imparting to him this
important information. Bismarck assured his
police-minister that he was already acquainted
with the plot to assassinate the Tsar.</p>

<p>"But," added the Chancellor, "we must allow
this act to be attempted and for political reasons.
Nevertheless, we can assure the safety of the
Emperor by having the conspirators shadowed
and arrested once they have fired their revolvers.
You, Stieber, must have your men on the spot,
and when the attempt is made, the assailant's aim
must be deflected. The very fact that an attack
is made upon the Tsar while in Paris will prevent
the arranging of a Franco-Russian alliance which
is not just now to the interests of Prussia, and
if the would-be assassin is not condemned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
death, a period of estrangement must follow
between France and Russia and this is just as I
would have things to be."</p>

<p>As it fell out, a young Pole actually made the
attempt on the next day. Stieber's men had
shadowed him all through the night, till the very
moment in which he fired at the Tsar, the outrage
taking place, but without harmful results to the
object of the attack. All had fallen out as
Bismarck had foretold, and with the subsequent
failure of a Paris jury to convict the youthful
Pole, France was prevented, by the estrangement
which succeeded, from assuring herself the friendship
of an ally whose support might have changed
the history of the Franco-German War of 1870.
The story is told in detail in Stieber's own Memoirs,
and we confess that, having read it several times
with care, we are ourselves forced to the conclusion
that Bismarck's supposition that a French jury
would fail to convict the Pole was based upon
something much more tangible than the arts and
processes of divination. In other words, the
impression left upon the mind is that Bismarck's
gold had subsidised the conspirators in the plot
as well as the Paris jurymen, in order to bring
about a political situation which should not
interfere with his plans. Bismarck had already
more than once proved himself an expert in
preparing his schemes far in advance, as the
Danish and Austrian wars had already proved,
and as the Franco-German War was even more
fully to demonstrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>When, in due course, and as a result of Bismarck's
plan of forcing a fight on the French
at the psychological moment, war was declared
against France in July 1870, Stieber and his
two lieutenants, Zernicki and Kaltenbach, left
for the Front with the headquarters staff. His
title was Chief of the Active-Service Police and
his duties, drawn up by himself, were as
follows:—</p>

<p>1. To provide information to the Staff regarding
the situation, strength and movements of each
of the French armies in the field.</p>

<p>2. To provide all possible details with regard
to the age, the disposition and character and the
personal and military reputation of each commander,
his possible successor in the command
and other superior officers. In respect of this
provision, it is interesting to learn that part of
the report regarding the late General de Gallifet,
the cavalry leader and hero of Sedan, was given
in approximately the following terms:—"This
officer is one who under Napoleon the First would
have held the highest rank. A real Frenchman,
with his heart in the war and a hater of all things
Prussian. A fighter for the initiative, by every
instinct, a dangerous adversary and, for us,
better dead. Should be watched; has no thought
for anything in the present war but the success
of the French arms."</p>

<p>3. Reports as to the political dispositions and
temper of all districts for twenty miles ahead
of the advancing Prussian armies, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the capacity of each district for supplying the
commissariat.</p>

<p>4. To have available at every point of importance
traversed by our armies several persons of
intelligence who can give directions as to routes,
sources of supplies and so forth. In other words,
the purchase of traitors.</p>

<p>5. To arrange that suitable persons shall be in
residence at each important point who are willing
to accommodate such persons as the Staff may
designate.</p>

<p>When questioned by von Roon as to the likelihood
of his being able to facilitate their armies'
progress by supplying commanders with so much
information, Stieber boastfully replied: "All
this information is not only ready; it is already
printed. Remember, my army has been entrenched
in France for nearly two years." It
was also at this time that Stieber informed von
Roon that <em>his</em> army counted nearly 40,000 persons
of both sexes—an army corps, almost. In
the first three months of the campaign the chief
of police held a position which was as much a
puzzle to German generals themselves as to
departmental officials connected with the army.
Stieber, when Bismarck and the King of Prussia
were not present, exercised a power which no
general durst override, since his own department
was officially independent and in war-time the
existence of martial law added to his summary
powers. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear
that the boastful sleuth displayed a ferocity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
disposition to the conquered populations which
one always suspects to be part of his base and
treacherous character. As an exponent of the
arts of terrorism, he must have regaled the heart
of the bloodiest of Hohenzollerns. Children,
old men and invalids were flogged, spread-eagle
fashion, and in the presence of their parents and
relatives, with the object of forcing the elders
of municipalities to reveal information. Women
and girls were violated in the same interests,
while summary executions became the order of
the police-minister's passing. "Oppose me," he
would cry to cowering mayors and magistrates
who begged mercy for their townsmen, "and
I will hang a hundred of your people." The
successful mongrel was clearly in his element in
those days; nor did he omit any opportunity of
adding to his collection of orders and medals with
all of which he was accustomed to adorn his breast
on every possible and impossible occasion. Not
at all a welcome guest at mess-tables, the spy
was nevertheless invited on more than one
occasion to dine with Bismarck and his staff.
We may easily suppose that the diplomatic corps
gave the man the cold shoulder at all times.
An official at one of these field banquets having
just observed that the German army was invincible,
Stieber, on his own record, jumped up
brusquely and declared that the speaker should
have said that the German <em>armies</em> were invincible.
"My army," continued the braggart, "has already
preceded your army by six months." Bismarck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
who had noted throughout the evening the many
slights put upon the spy, thereupon rose from his
seat and passed round to Stieber's, when "without
a word, but looking straight into my eyes, he
held out to me his left hand wide open, which I
clasped tightly in both of mine," to quote the
Memoirs.</p>

<p>What Bismarck was wont to term "action on
the Press" was undertaken also by Stieber during
the course of the war of 1870. For this purpose
the sleuth had in 1868 requested Bismarck for
an appropriation of £15,000 annually, in return for
which he promised the Chancellor to make many
of the important provincial and other French
papers "talk Prussian," as he put it. In a large
measure he may be said to have contributed to the
modern importance which has grown up around
the Press, and by 1870 he declared that he could
control the opinions of some eighty-five writers
in the French daily and weekly newspapers. He
had divided his corps of writers into <em>home</em> and
<em>foreign</em> bodies. Writers, for example, who were
able to influence the insertion of articles favourable
to Prussia and Prussian policies were paid
several times the amount which they commonly
received for their articles through the ordinary
channels of remuneration. These foreign writers
were not confined to France, but were active also
in Austria, Italy and England. Well-known
bankers, business men and the heads of news
agencies—many of them German Hebrews—were
the instruments through whom Stieber worked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Most of these individuals were able, through
acquaintanceship with professional leader-writers
and journalists, to procure the insertion into
articles of views held by the Prussian Government;
such gentry were themselves receiving Prussian
Orders and decorations, while their particular
private scribes were rewarded in cash. It was
by means of Germans occupying high positions in
the public life of European countries that in 1864
the world was prepared intellectually for the
partition of Denmark, in 1866 for the war with
Austria and thenceforth for the federation of
the Germanic States under the ægis of Prussia.
It must not be imagined that this propaganda
ceased with Prussia's attainment of the headship
of the Teutonic Bond. Indeed, it may be said
only to have been inaugurated with its early
successes under Bismarck, whose control of a venal
Press in Vienna, Rome and even London was
hardly less effective in its day than that which
he exploited and subsidised all over Germany.
By 1870 Stieber had, he himself tells, assured
himself of a Press in Lyons, Marseilles and
Bordeaux, which kept the Prussian view openly
and permanently before the inhabitants of those
important cities.</p>

<p>There is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> about Stieber's autobiography
which recalls Le Caron. During a memorable
evening spent in the company of Bismarck, "the
most beautiful of my life," says the spy, conversation
turned upon the question of opportunity
as the condition of success in life. The Chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sought to point the moral of his philosophy in
the matter by the following words:—"Just consider,
Stieber," he said, "how far and high destiny
has led a tramp like yourself who was hated by
everybody." That conversation, writes the spy,
may become historic; and he rejoices to think
of the good fortune which has enabled him to
serve Bismarck, "assuredly the greatest of modern
men." Again, he is frankness itself when he
declares that his aide-de-camp Zernicki represented
the elements of courtesy and kindliness,
while he himself had no thought for anything
but action and results and certainly no time to
expend upon formalities. In all his remarks upon
his records and successes we inevitably get the
true note of the upstart who has achieved the
power of making other men fear him. Thus,
at Versailles, the police agent, for some minor
offence, threatened to "hang ten members of
the municipal committee as sure as my name is
Stieber," and wrote to his wife recording the fact
with much self-glory and glee. His part in the
execution of a young gentleman, Monsieur de
Raynal, was especially characteristic. This
resident of Versailles, who had just recently
returned from his honeymoon, had been in the
habit of keeping a diary recording the daily
occurrences of the German occupation. Stieber
could easily have settled the matter with a
reprimand. "No," he said, "I must have an
example. M. de Raynal is a young man who
writes very interesting matter. I am sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
him, but he will have to face the rifles. If he
escapes, I will allow him to go free." When told
that the young man had just recently been
married, he replied with mock feeling, "That
makes my duty all the more painful," and Raynal
was accordingly shot. In truth the Prussian
sleuth was an ideal type of the official who would
"hang the guiltless rather than eat his mutton
cold," and though there is no statistical record
of the number of lives which he sacrificed in the
interests of his policy of terrorism, there can be
no doubt that it could only have been expressed
in terms of scores.</p>

<p>On his arrival with the headquarters staff and
the King of Prussia at Versailles in September
1870, Stieber took up his lodgings at an important
hotel belonging to the Duc de Persigny and here
he also housed his corps of active-service agents,
numbering altogether 120. It is hard to credit
the statement, but the authority, M. Paul Lanoir,
declares that the police-minister was successful
in enlisting the services of some 10,000 persons
in Versailles who, in consideration of the payment
of one franc daily, agreed to "acclaim with cheers
and hurrahs the Prussian monarch and princes
whenever they made their excursions into the
neighbourhood." Another first-class authority,
M. Victor Tissot, seems by his remarks to disprove
the statement of Renan to the effect that it is
well-nigh impossible to find a traitor among
Frenchmen. Tissot assures us that Stieber's
work in France was much facilitated by the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that the Prussian secret service was paying large
salaries to important men in French public life,
in return for information supplied. The same
Paul Lanoir whom we have quoted above also
states that Prussian gold has been active in
French political life up till within quite recent
times. He has met and still knows men, he says,
who entered politics without a decent coat to their
names who have become as if by magic possessed
of splendid mansions, and whose wives, formerly
milliners or washerwomen, have now taken to
giving receptions on a lavish scale. These politicians
would seem to be political only to the
extent that they represent a purely personal
policy of their own, for, says Lanoir, they continue
to "champion the cause of the people," the
assumption being that they are paid <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i>
in the service of Germany whose duty
it is to keep the Republic in a state of such unrest
that it must fall an easy prey to an attack from
outside. M. Lanoir's statements apply, it is only
right to add, to that period of grave unrest in
France which succeeded upon the Church crisis
and the Moroccan difficulties, and which may be
said to have closed by 1911.</p>

<p>It is necessary unfortunately to follow this man
Stieber to the close of his career and for the reason
that the modern system of espionage in Germany,
in regard to both its home and foreign relations,
is based wholly on the methods which he laid
down after the Franco-German War of 1870.
He returned to Berlin a more important man than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
ever, with several more decorations to add to his
already heavily bestarred chest. At this period
he possessed a house in the neighbourhood of the
Hallesches Thor and was credited with the possession
of about 1,000,000 marks or £50,000 sterling.
His womenfolk proved a source of some anxiety
to him in a social sense, and not even the patronage
of the omnipotent Chancellor von Bismarck
could induce the exclusive classes of Berlin to
look upon them with favour. Prussian vulgarity
possesses a brand entirely its own, and the House
of Stieber appeared to be afflicted with all its
worst symptoms, including the inability to realise
that position, even supported by wealth, which
owed its existence to a talent for exploiting the
basest characteristics of human nature, must
ever, except among the most servile and venal,
remain isolated and practically ostracised during
at least the life of its founders. We are therefore
not surprised to learn that in order to maintain
some outward semblance of an important rôle in
society for his family, Stieber was forced to resort
to a kind of blackmail, in which he threatened
persons of high social worth, who consistently
refused to meet his relatives, with the revelation
of domestic secrets of the most intimate nature.
In this way, he effected some progress, though it
is also well known that he became instrumental
in driving several notable personages permanently
back to their country estates. Stieber himself
made no secret of his philosophy in such matters.
"To hold a certain power over men who are my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
superiors, is the sweetest power I have known,
and accounts in many ways for my success," is
a remark attributed to the sleuth. Like many
another well-known <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveau riche</i> of modern days,
whose rise to vast wealth has served only to emphasise
an elemental ineptitude for the wielding
of public power, Stieber feared the Theatre as a
potential flagellant of his ignoble self, and to this
end exercised, through subsidiary agents, a veritable
censorship upon the German drama. In
order to provide against this possibility of seeing
himself burlesqued upon the stage by some rising
Molière, he was at great pains to procure the
position of censors for members of his personal
acquaintance, and even in the literary world his
secret influence was always at work. His ambition
to possess the "particle of nobility," <em>von</em>,
the old Emperor William firmly withstood, nor
could the Chancellor move his master to include
Stieber in any list promoting the sleuth to Adelstand,
as the Germans term the condition of
noble rank.</p>

<p>It was perhaps with some remorseful consciousness
of the sorry tenor of his whole career that
Stieber, about 1875, decided to exercise his talents
in a more important branch of high politics than
had been possible up to that time. Perhaps, too,
it was with his pathetic quest of a patent of
nobility in view that the sleuth thought out a
plan for the consolidation of imperial Germany,
which in his opinion must recommend itself to
his omnipotent friend Bismarck. We do not, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
course, rely implicitly on all he says in his Memoirs;
but there is little doubt that his intimacy with
the Chancellor was of the closest kind and that
Bismarck encouraged his police-minister's counsels
to every possible furtherance of imperial plans.
It used credibly to be said that Stieber, who was,
of course, a man of good education, especially
sought out the historian Mommsen with a view
to discussing with that luminary something about
the secret of Rome's predominance in the world
and of her hold upon her conquests. No records
remain of any such conversations if they ever really
took place, but we may be sure that if they did
take place, Stieber was put in full possession of
those principles of "dividing in order to govern";
of the strategic value of roads; of the garrisoning
of subject countries by the troops of races mutually
antipathetic; of the value of blood-letting in
political combinations, to quote a memorable
phrase of Napoleon. In any case by the year
1880, Stieber had presented a memorial to Prince
Bismarck the political effects arising from which
have been seen down to the most recent times
and have mainly contributed to the costly militarism
of the past generation. The railway systems
of Germany were to be developed in the main
with regard to their strategic military values, a
consideration which had only been partly realised
in the earlier construction of lines. In the second
place, large appropriations for German Secret
Service funds were annually to be set aside with
the object of buying, or placing, traitors in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
great country in Europe with which the German
Empire, in accordance with its plan of dominating
the Western World, was likely ever to come into
conflict. As will be seen later, no country in
Europe became exempt from the operations of
German emissaries whether as spies or else as
the agents of domestic unrest and revolution and
all to the end that the new <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbs sacra</i>, Berlin,
should be to the modern world all that Rome was
to that of antiquity. It is not difficult therefore
to understand that the secret-service fund
sanctioned by the Reichstag had grown from
£52,000 in 1867 to the sum of £800,000 in 1910.</p>

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>The German railway system radiates from Berlin,
not according to the concessional plans of other
countries, but in accordance with the definite
warlike designs and conceptions of the military
authorities whose ulterior aim is a confederation
of all European States governed from Berlin.
Thus, the great network of railways is divided into
military divisions, the most familiar of which to
us are Berlin, Magdeburg, Hanover and Cologne,
the first of the strategic lines of attack which is
directed like a pistol at the French frontier and
which co-operates with parallel systems with
depôts at Coblentz and Elberfeld. Along these
lines German military authorities profess to be able
to transport, within twenty-four hours of the order
to mobilise, a number not far short of 1,000,000
men, together with full equipment, commissariat
and war material. At the head of each of the
railway divisions is a military officer whose
functions are much similar to those of a general
commanding an army; under him is a staff of
officers, non-commissioned officers and men who
in reality "run" the system and are responsible
for its working in regard to freights, passenger
transportation and time-schedules. And since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the railway systems are designed primarily for
military purposes—as were the old Roman roads—little
if any consideration has been paid in their
construction to commercial or industrial requirements.
In every respect the systems are regarded
as, first of all, the means of military transportation,
and accordingly, wherever any portion or portions
of a given line may appear to be exposed to hostile
attack, principles of ordinary fortification are
adopted. The depôts are mainly built with
commissarial objects in view. The personnel of
the systems, guards, ticket collectors, engine-drivers,
are all military in every sense (including
the worst) of that term, as no one who has ever
travelled over the German-Belgian boundaries
at Herbesthal and met the dictatorial German
railway guard for the first time will require to be
told. Along these lines, which radiate from
Berlin to the French frontier, it has been laid
down as one of the most stringent of official
German regulations that:</p>

<p>"No native of Alsace or Lorraine, even if
performing his military service in Germany, shall,
under any circumstances whatever, be recruited or
admitted in any capacity, no matter how minor, for
employment on German divisional railroads."</p>

<p>On the other hand Stieber had seen to it that
as many hundreds of Alsatians and Lorrainers
who were willing to enter his service should be
employed by the French railway systems at the
other side of the Frontier as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> Frenchmen.
In accordance with their engagement to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Stieber, they were paid at the rate of twenty-five
per cent. of the wages they were drawing from
their French employers, and until 1884 there were
at least 1500 of them so serving both the French
system and the German espionage bureau. In
1884 the French Government was roused to a
realisation of the peril of allowing these men to
work on their railroads, and they were rapidly
removed. It is on record that in 1880 Stieber
had promised the old Emperor William that on
the day on which Germany should again mobilise
her armies, he himself could guarantee for the railways
of France over 1000 trusted agents who were
prepared, by destroying locomotives and other railroad
stock, to paralyse the French mobilisation to
the Frontier in such a way that German armies
should have fairly approached the capital before
the Republic had got her forces decisively in hand.</p>

<p>In regard to the second part of his programme—namely,
that which was to create factions, unrest
and revolutionary conditions in countries which
were to become the objects of German military
aggression—Stieber developed the ideas which still
hold good in the plans of the German Secret
Service. The main principle underlying his plan
of campaign was the fomenting of industrial disorders.
In each case a literary propaganda was
to precede action, which was first to be undertaken
by trained spies and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i>
who were capable, by the common methods of
political and industrial agitators, of promoting
class antipathies. German enterprise in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
respect has not been confined to France, but has
been active in every country in Europe, including
England. In 1893 the successor of Bismarck,
Count Caprivi, signed an appropriation of £4000
for the purposes of "providing foreign pamphlets
and publications useful to the policy of the
Empire." In later years the sum was increased
to £20,000, while a number of paid agitators,
inciting the great industrial centres of France, of
Belgium, of Russia and (it is recorded) of England,
is said to have drawn large sums from the German
funds. The recent epidemic of industrial strikes
in France, Russia and England is declared to
have been fomented by paid agitators working
on behalf of German authorities—some of them
unconsciously, and as a result of the influence
exerted by publications which had been subsidised
by German gold. There are French
writers who still maintain that the Dreyfus
agitation was initiated and supported with the
connivance of the highest military authorities in
Berlin for the purpose of destroying one of the
most potent forces in France—namely, belief and
trust in the Army. Most of us, at all events, will
recollect how towards the close of the momentous
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Affaire</i>, when the Republic was already weakened
by the series of national and international crises
attending on the entire event, ominous threats
of mobilisation were more than once made from
Berlin. Again, the memorable Associations Bill,
which enacted the disestablishment of the Church
in France, was said to have owed its conception to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
German secret-service agents. To this movement—bound
in any case to awaken the cupidity of
venal politicians, in view of the vast Congregational
possessions involved—succeeded the era
of Syndicalist unrest, and finally the outbreak of
the war of 1914. Nor can Englishmen forget that
the so-called Agadir incident of the spring of 1911
coincided with one of the most devastating
strikes Britain has yet known. In view of what
we now know, there can hardly be a doubt that
German plans and policies had meditated the
paralysing of our transport system and our coal-supplies.
Nor is there, again, the least possible
doubt that for many years past German "philosophers,"
drawing pay from the secret-service
funds, have been instructing British as well as
French and Russian workmen in the art of combining
"in defence of their rights" against the
privileged classes. In Germany such revolutionary
doctrines never leave the theoretical
stage, nor could they do so, given the system of
government which is in principle and practice
hardly different from martial law. Most people
who have been resident for any time in Germany
will, in this regard, recollect an old piece of advice
which friendly elders are accustomed to give their
juniors—namely, that in the Fatherland every
good citizen is required to "pay taxes, build
barracks and shut his mouth." When one considers
this pearl of civic wisdom in conjunction
with the unwritten law which requires that even
the public portraits of all royal and princely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
personages shall be criticised favourably, or not
at all, one is bound to admit that anything like
Anglo-Saxon liberty of opinion or outspokenness
is still far removed from the ordinary life of your
German of to-day.</p>

<p>In order to indicate the operation of the German
secret service in regard to the spreading of revolutionary
unrest among neighbouring countries,
we cannot do better than cite the publication
which was addressed to Ireland, the supposedly
"revolted province," in the early days of August
1914. Here are the terms of that historic
manifesto which moved all Ireland to mirth for
many a day:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"IRISH FOOLS!</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten that England is your only
enemy?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten, Kathleen, that you are
willing to shed your blood to win England's
battles?</p>

<p>"Have you lost your wits that you believe all
the ridiculous lies published against the Germans
in the Jingo papers?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten how the English treated
the Boers?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten Ninety-Eight?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the Manchester Martyrs?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the K.O.S.B. murders?</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten that the Future lies in
your hands?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<p>"Have you forgotten that England's difficulty
is Ireland's opportunity?</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">God Save Ireland.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that so obviously
crude and inartistic an appeal had no effect
upon an essentially acute and artistic race; and
its positive inartisticity bears the hall-mark of
your Prussian's incapacity for entering into the
more intimate feelings of men of other nations,
a point which need hardly be laboured, having
in view recent and current bovine misconceptions
on the part of German diplomatic agents both in
Europe and America.</p>

<p>A more serious attempt to "revolutionise"
French railway systems was made in 1893 some
few months after the granting of £4000 from the
secret-service funds for the purposes of international
pamphleteering. In August of that year
the Mesnard pamphlet made its appearance
containing an appeal to all workers connected
with the railroad systems of France and urging
them to take advantage of their country's dependence
upon them in order to wring concessions
in money from the Government, failing which a
general and permanent strike was to be declared
having the inevitable result of paralysing the
country's energies and exposing it to attack on
the part of its traditional enemy. The pamphlet
was proved to have been issued from Geneva,
a chief centre of the German international secret-service
body. It was promptly disavowed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the labour unions of France, and it was well
recognised at that period that its appearance
was timed to create an industrial upheaval to
coincide with the friction which the Dreyfus
Affair was then causing between French and
German diplomatists. During the course of
several general strikes which have taken place
in France within the past twenty years, it has
clearly come to light that the charitable subscriptions
made in support of the families of
strikers by Frenchmen have been exceeded by contributions
coming from German "sympathisers,"
in the proportion of twenty sovereigns to one.
In the famous strike of boot-makers at Amiens
in May 1893, for example, local subscriptions
amounted to £48. At least £1000 was sent direct
from Frankfurt!<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> "In the last fifteen years,"
wrote Lanoir in 1910, "the instigation of strikes
in French industries has been raised by the
directors of the German Secret Police to the degree
of a real principle of government." The same
authority states that in 1893 he heard an ultra-Radical
parliamentary candidate for the Seine
Department declare that a German admirer,
whom he did not know, had sent him £100
towards his election expenses. Stieber in his
Memoirs affects to believe that this sum is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>commonly sent to any French parliamentarian
who advocates a policy which is thought to be
useful to German imperial interests.</p>

<p>Stieber died in 1892, being honoured with a
public funeral at which the highest personages
in Berlin were officially represented. His fortune
amounted to nearly £100,000 of our money and
he possessed both a town residence in Berlin and
a villa in the Hartz Range. He had been successful
in accumulating throughout his public career
twenty-three decorations testifying to his <em>Honour</em>,
and as this would appear to have been his chief
ambition in life, there can be little doubt that the
sleuth died happy. It is customary to say that
Stieber took with him to his grave the essential
secrets underlying his organisation of a national
system of internal and external espionage.
Frankly we think that this can hardly have been
the case, since the operations of German espionage
have at all times clearly proved themselves
traceable to definitely ascertainable objects and
plans. Nor do we think that the German system
holds anything more in the way of elemental
secrets to be revealed, and the excellent systems
of counter-espionage adopted by British and
French authorities justify us in our belief. Price
Collier's pregnant statement that the Germans
have organised themselves into an organisation,
ahead of which they are incapable of thinking or
planning, may well be held to apply to their
organised espionage, and Stieber's elaboration of
its arts may be taken to have reached the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
possible point. In bursts of friendly confidence,
and presumably as a matter of proving the ineluctable
superiority of the Teuton over the poor
Anglo-Saxon, German lecturers in English
universities have occasionally permitted their
patriotic sentiments so far to exceed the bounds
of official reticence as to throw a certain amount
of light upon this mystic bag-of-tricks which is
going to assure to the House of Hohenzollern the
overlordship of the five continents and the seven
seas. According to one of these German professors
whom we well and, indeed, affectionately
remember, the high priests of the policy of
Prussianisation have thought out the whole
matter along lines alleged to have been laid down
by the Hebrew Elders in accordance with their
policy of recovering the world for the Chosen
Race. According to this interesting system of
Jewish Eugenics, the racial stock of Sem is to be
permanently assured as to its integrity by enforcing
the marriage of all male Jews with Jewesses.
Result: all-Jewish offspring. The superfluous
women of the Hebrew families are to be distributed
as far as possible among the Gentile
males, especially among those who possess means,
with the object of ensuring that the resultant
offspring shall possess such an admixture of
Jewish blood as to make it at least sympathetic
towards Jews and Jewish ideas. And as sympathetic
qualities come in the main from the
distaff side, the eugenic results must inevitably
favour Hebrew propagandism. We might go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
further into this matter and point out that the
Jewish rite of circumcision was not meant to be
simply hygienic in its effects and reach. We will
not labour the point, however, but proceed to
indicate the analogy—according to the learned
German lecturer.</p>

<p>Prussia, said our authority, had appropriated
large sums from the indemnity of £200,000,000
sterling which she had obtained from France in
1870, for the purpose of establishing her "national
missionaries" in every quarter of the world.
Men were chosen according to their abilities to
preside over the destinies of foreign commercial
houses, banking institutions, agencies of all kinds,
commission and money-lending businesses and
contracting corporations. These men were really
in the pay of the Berlin authorities who were
financing the various firms in question and paying
their agents large or small profits in proportion
to the turnover of each particular business. It
was, however, certain that every German, no
matter what his position, was really acting in the
interests of Germany, and so the ubiquitous
German clerk was enabled to undersell the labour
of the British clerk for the good reason that the
deficit was offset in his particular case by a
quarterly grant from official German sources.
The intermarriage of Germans with British
women was not only smiled upon, but a premium
was actually paid in each case and unknown to
the women. The children were, as far as possible,
brought up in sympathy with German institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and ideas and taught to revere the chief of
Hohenzollern as the potential overlord of every
country which came within the operations and
purview of German ambitions and land-lust.
In the event of war and in accordance with
this propagandism, "everything went," as the
Americans say. In the early days of the conquest
of Belgian territories in 1914 we saw how particular
attention was paid to the younger unmarried
women, as in Louvain, to give but one example.
These women were interned in a sort of concentration
camp and systematically seduced,
making it a last possible hope for many a hapless
victim to accept a German husband, who in his
own turn was offered either a premium or promotion,
whether civil or military, for marrying
the lady, as the saying is. It is not necessary to
pursue this theme to the extent to which it is
capable of being emphasised. It is sufficient
for us to reflect that the main principles upon
which German ideas of conquest are based are not
only vicious and immoral in themselves, but are
openly admitted and encouraged by the German
civil, military and cultural authorities who have
raised their apostolic voices in the cause of
Prussian propagandism. Those who possess even
an elementary acquaintance with the history of
nations do not require to be told that, with the
object of forcing "sympathies," methods quite
as outrageous as those cited above have more
than once been resorted to and, notably, in the
early days of Rome's founding. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
well said that Stieberism has had the result of
demoralising the entire German nation by putting
a premium on treachery and immorality in the
pursuit of special information and so has made
that trade a career open to the talents of all who
care to adopt it. Responsible ministers have
declared more than once in the imperial parliament
at Berlin their concurrence in the view that
"all is justifiable" in the interests of the future
of the Fatherland, and in this regard we remember
that not so long ago Herr Richter, the leader of
the Opposition, raised a protest reflecting on the
doubtful character of the secret-service agents
of the Government only to receive from Puttkamer
the now-stereotyped retort:</p>

<p>"It is the right and duty of the German
Imperial Government to employ all possible and
necessary methods in order to secure for the State
the benefits of useful intelligence, and if the
Minister of Police has had success by employing
doubtful persons for his purposes, I personally
express to him my satisfaction and thanks."</p>

<p>The particular methods to which Richter had
taken exception included the bribing of magistrates,
politicians and wealthy industrialists to
give up information in their possession. Some
of the most disreputable night-houses in Berlin
were protected by the police for the reason that
they had become the fashionable rendezvous
of officers and diplomatists who, in their cups,
were easily induced to give up information regarding
their superiors, which the secret-service sleuths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
were anxious to obtain with the object of creating
situations that left important public men at their
own mercy or else at the mercy of men immeasurably
higher up. Much has been written about
the "high sense of virtue" which prompted the
famous revelations which were made by Harden
in his publication <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Zukunft</cite> in 1907. We
do not personally question the sense of virtue
possessed by the German editor, but it is certain
that the opinion was current in Berlin in the
succeeding year that reasons of State had required
the removal from official life of many of the
high social and political personages implicated in
the scandals, and that the apparently "private"
information possessed by an editor was selected
as the easiest means of forcing them irrevocably
from public life. Knowing what we do of the
exiguous liberties of the Prussian Press, it is
quite obvious that the life of an editor who should
venture, of his own initiative and authority, to
divulge a tenth part of the story which was
printed in the <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Zukunft</cite>, would not have been
worth an hour's purchase in militaristic Berlin.
And here we recur to the statement once made
by an old servant of Frederick the Great to the
famous Count d'Antraigues: "That day on which
you begin to imagine your services are indispensable
to him will be your last day. He has no
heart, and the very thought that you possess a
claim on his friendship will suffice to destroy you."</p>

<p>It is essential before passing from Stieber to
consider his methods of covering a foreign country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
with a fully organised system of German spies,
and all the more so because the work done in
modern days by Steinhauer and his congeners is
based altogether on the conceptions of Bismarck's
sleuth. We have seen that in 1870, when the
German armies crossed the frontiers of France,
they had already been assured, through the
energies and foresight of Stieber, of the co-operation
of some 36,000 spies in Northern and
Eastern France who were to smooth the way for
von Moltke's advancing legions. Indeed, Stieber's
work largely discounts that of both Bismarck and
von Moltke, if it does not wholly supersede it.
In his Memoirs the sleuth tells how Bismarck,
when told that Jules Favre was putting out
feelers for the surrender of Paris in 1871, sent
for his lieutenant, instructing him to keep Favre
under the closest possible observation during the
course of the negotiations. The Prussian and
French statesmen met at Versailles, where Stieber
had made all necessary arrangements for lodging
the visitor. He selected for this purpose, and
unknown, of course, to Favre, the headquarters
of the German Secret Police Service—Stieber's
own office. The Frenchman was given as valet
a man whom the proprietor highly recommended.
This valet was Stieber himself, who, during Favre's
whole stay at Versailles, acted for the statesman
in the most menial capacities, taking care during
his master's absence to ransack the latter's
luggage and examine all his voluminous correspondence
entering from Paris. Stieber boasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that much of the information he thus obtained
formed the basis of the negotiations on which
peace terms were concluded. Moritz Busch in
his Memoirs makes no especial mention of
the sleuth's services in this regard, and we may
dismiss Stieber's claim to have counted for much
in the peace negotiations as being characteristically
overdrawn.</p>

<p>He was, however, active in the remapping
of the invasion zones in 1871 for the operations
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espions</i>, the members of which, in
regard to all French territories, were from that
year chosen mainly from among the French-speaking
Swiss. He laid it down as a condition
of the "fixed-point" spy's employment that he
should be the keeper of a shop of some kind, a
public-house, a tobacconist's, an hotel, a grocery
of an established character and certain to attract
custom from the townspeople. Each spy was
to assume the character of an honest peace-loving
citizen, anxious to give public service and
make himself personally popular. He was to
receive in payment some £4 a week besides out-of-pocket
expenses to Brussels, or Lausanne, or
Geneva where his particular reports were made
and whence his salary was paid every month in
the form of business remittances. The system
of counter-espionage adopted in France during
the past five and twenty years has undoubtedly
had the effect of neutralising the work of the
fixed-point agent. Nevertheless, it is certain that
in August 1914 there were some 15,000 of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
still operating throughout France. Paul Lanoir
gives a specimen of the remittance letters which
pass between the chief spy inspector and his
agent, the fixed-point expert. In some cases
they are ordinary business letters; but in the
larger number they affect to be communications
between relatives. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,—I am sending you the
interest on your loan. We never can forget your
generous act in coming so promptly to our assistance.
Things are not going too badly; next
year, perhaps, you may have a larger share in
our profits, and we are anxious you should have
as much as possible. But write more often giving
us fuller news. Do not abuse Uncle Charles; he
is a very good man who is to be trusted always.
We are all well here, but have only just managed
to pull through a hard winter. My husband and
the children send you our greetings, as also do
Charlotte, Charles and Frederick. Your loving
sister."</p></div>

<p>Occasionally a man is suspected of being a spy.
He is asked to produce his foreign correspondence,
and does so, giving some such letter as the above
in token of his integrity.</p>

<p>"There!" he is certain to say, "that's the sort
of spy <em>I</em> am—a kind and loving brother who has
lent money to his relatives to keep them out of
the poorhouse. And this is a letter which encloses
me the interest on my loan." And then, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the fixed-point agent gives way to tears. Nevertheless,
the above apparently harmless message
is well understood by our spy who reads it as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I enclose your salary for the past month.
Your reports of last month are not bad. On the
whole your work is satisfactory and next year
you may get a better salary. Nevertheless, your
reports are too few in number; work harder,
send more. Don't trouble about Uncle Charles;
we have all the information we require. We
got through the last inspection without loss of
salary. Keep up your relations with your
correspondents."</p></div>

<p>It is obvious that our residential spy is not
allowed to select his place of business at random.
His location is at some strategical point in the
line of military advance, mapped out some years
ahead. Thus, our agent can spy upon the local
garrison, upon a military post, a railway depot,
a terminal, and at any critical moment he has his
own corps of agents—some of them, alas, unconscious
traitors—ready, for a few francs, to do his
bidding, among them, perhaps, a poor charwoman
or an unemployed labourer. In country towns
in France it is not hard for a prosperous man of
business to make friends with the officers of the
garrison. Sooner or later and after a series of
visits to the billiard-table, or the hotel bar, he
discovers among his military acquaintances needy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
young officers who are in debt, who have lost
heavily on the race-courses, and it is not long
before he begins to talk of his large winnings on
the turf. The way is quickly opened to a loan, and
then the German Secret Service begins to find
out things. Naturally our residential spy keeps
his book of expenses and is duly recouped for
his outlays on drinks, dinners, race-course visits
and loans, with interest at 5 per cent. And if
the spy is unable to make headway with a young
officer, there is always a possibility of his being
able to bribe the officer's wife or mistress, and
his allowance of earnest-money is practically
unlimited. So that, when we consider how our
agent is a man of leisure who fishes the local
streams, and has plumbed their various depths;
how he keeps horses and knows the average
amount of forage available in his town at any
given moment; how he has shot over the outlying
country and knows the lie of the land for miles
around; how he is on visiting terms with every
local farmer and knows his resources—why, it
is not surprising that when German armies are
moved across the frontiers, they should know
every step of the country much better than the
inhabitants themselves are likely ever to know it.
And so with Belgium and England, where there
is not a farmhouse, a strategic copse or upland,
the depth of a river, or military capacity of a
given road, which is not as well known to the
headquarters staff in Berlin as to our own
ordnance-surveyors.</p>

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>The strategic ideas laid down more than two
thousand years ago by Polyænus, of whom we
have spoken in an earlier chapter, and to whom
Napoleon admitted some indebtedness, are evidently
rated high among the military authorities
of the Berlin military academies. It is therefore
not surprising to learn that in accordance with
the Greek's teachings every foreign general or
superior officer of note who is considered likely
ever to play a prominent rôle in European wars,
is in each case as well known to the German
military authorities as he is to his own military
superiors. His personal character, disposition,
virtues, vices and foibles, once an officer reaches
to high rank and acquires a reputation as a possible
commander, all form the subject of one of those
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossiers</i> with which the Dreyfus case made us so
familiar. It is a main part of the duty of our
fixed-point agent to collect all sorts of information
regarding the chief garrison officers at the
town in which they are established and transmit
the resulting data to their inspectors by whom,
when verified, they are forwarded to military
headquarters. The especial categories which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
claim the attention of the German authorities are
the following:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Generals and officers of superior rank and
high repute.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The staff-college professors at Saint-Cyr,
the École Polytechnique and Saint-Maixent, the
disciplinarians, bursars and superior employés of
these institutions.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The managers of all arsenals and military
establishments.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) All aides-de-camp and staff-officers.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) All superior employés in the department
of the Ministers of War and the Navy.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Special information as to the financial and
domestic conditions and relations of all those
officers mentioned in the above categories who
are known or thought to be "unsettled" in their
mode of life.</p>

<p>It is also stated that promising cadets from the
military and naval academies are at once registered
at Berlin and honoured with their respective
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossiers</i>. Lanoir is the chief authority for
the above-mentioned details, and as a trained
journalist, he gives an instance of the working of
the spy in a case which came directly under his
notice. The fixed-point agent in question had
found it somewhat difficult to penetrate into the
society of the superior officers at a garrison town.
He therefore decided to find out all he required
through certain subaltern officers who were accustomed
to frequent his place of business—an
hotel, as it happened. Accordingly he called in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the services of an occasional visitor at the house—a
commercial traveller who was also a spy in
German pay. Possessed of all those gifts of the
genial man of the world, the supposed commercial
traveller found no difficulty whatever in
winning the confidence of junior officers whose
social talents were far in excess of their means
and who were quite willing to overlook the inferior
rank of their new acquaintance when they discovered
that with him the spending of money was
altogether a small consideration. It was not long
before one of the subalterns had confessed that
inability to keep up his position had necessitated
sending in his resignation, which had been
duly forwarded to the authorities. Expressing
sympathy in a fatherly way, the traveller requested
the young officer to inspect his own
military papers. "You will see that I, too, have
done my duty to France," he said, handing over
some forged certificates attesting military service,
for the manufacture of which Berlin has a special
department. "Knowing me for a good Frenchman,
perhaps you will treat me with more confidence."
The commercial man goes on to propose
that the subaltern shall enable him to do business
with the officers of the garrison. His particular
line of goods is hosiery, which he is willing to sell
to officers, since he is an ex-soldier himself, at
almost cost price. The subaltern is naturally
interested, but declares that he knows nothing
about business. The tempter then tells his young
friend that in reality he is travelling for his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
firm and can make a profit on the goods even if
he allows the subaltern 50 per cent. on everything
sold. "For every £4 worth of hosiery
I sell, you shall have a cheque for £2. As for
the difficulty of introductions—just say I am
your cousin; it is done every day and all over
France. It will be worth £250 a year to you."
The poor subaltern is not long in falling, and
by the end of the next month the commercial
traveller has wormed his way into the officers'
quarters, has learned all there is to be known
about the ammunition and ordnance stores, together
with personal details about superior officers,
which he could never have obtained in any other
way. German money is making up the deficit
on hosiery sold at cost price, but in return
Germany is getting far more than her money's
worth in military intelligence.</p>

<p>Lanoir also gives an instance in which one of
the most promising French officers of his generation
was, less than a score of years ago, paid
£8000 by a supposed man of wealth, a casual
garrison-town acquaintance, in order to rescue
his father from bankruptcy. The information
had come to the ears of the German tutor of a
French General to whom our young officer was
acting as aide-de-camp; the tutor forthwith
informed the German fixed-point agent, with the
result that the offer of £8000 was subsequently
made and accepted, the young officer in question
ultimately transferring his services to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dossier</i>
bureau attached to the Secret Police in Berlin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Another officer is said to have been given a sufficient
fortune by the German War Office to make
him an eligible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i> in the eyes of the daughter
of a well-known French General who was said to
possess especial knowledge regarding mobilisation
plans and arsenal material. The officer, whose
heart was elsewhere, as they say, accepted the
commission from Berlin, paid half-hearted court
to the lady in question, but was seen sufficiently
often in her company to justify the local agent's
belief in the young man's assertion that things
were going on famously. On his promise to
supply Berlin with copies of documents belonging
to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée's</i> father, they consented to advance
£10,000. He thereupon drew up plans of mobilisation
of his own, as well as details regarding
artillery, which he had himself thought out.
Eventually the price was paid in full, our officer
promising to reveal much more when the wedding
was over. Then he went off with the other lady,
and Berlin was badly beaten, though not, it is
certain, for the first time. Within the past ten
years it is well known that large sums of money
have been on several occasions paid for intelligence
regarding French and Russian fortifications, the
plans and specifications having been drawn up
by individuals who had deliberately devoted themselves
to military studies in order scientifically
to produce the "information" in question. Such
a set of plans was sold to Germany in 1909 by a
Pole, for a sum exceeding £4000. It is, however,
not often that the German military experts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
caught nodding, their sources of primary information
being as a rule excellent. They take few
risks, but then there is no source of possible
information which they overlook. This being so,
the extravagant wife of an army man is always an
object of interest to them, and many an officer
has fallen, owing to his desire to shield a venal
wife, blackmail, in such a case, being invariably
the method of coercing the husband.</p>

<p>If ever a nation has proved to the world that
she is devoid of essential military genius, that
nation is Germany. Her successful campaign of
1870 was almost entirely due, as we have seen, to
the preparations and plans laid down by Stieber
and his co-adjutors as well as the fact that France
had relied too much upon the traditional ability
of the French armies to cope successfully with
those of Germany. The same may be said of
Germany's "marvellous advance" towards Paris
in 1914, which was really a triumph for organised
espionage and by no means a proof that military
genius was inspiring the movements of the Kaiser's
hosts. This organised system of espionage has
for some years been in the hands of Major Steinhauer,
the present chief of the Berlin Secret Service,
and evidently a worthy successor to Stieber.
Belgium, as all know who have studied German
methods in what has been long known as the
"penetration area" of the Netherlands, was so
completely in the hands of German spies at the
outbreak of the war, that it was only the failure,
by a rare miscalculation, of the Berlin military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
authorities to have forwarded adequate siege-guns
to Liège which prevented the Imperial armies
marching through the country in a week and
reaching France sooner. The entry into the
Belgian capital of 700,000 men, without confusion
or mishap, has been credited to the military genius
of von Kluck and his lieutenants, the fact being
entirely overlooked that in view of the inevitable
war which Berlin expected to take place before
1915 (as a well-known German newspaper-proprietor
told American and Canadian reporters
in 1910) the German Secret Service authorities
had made an especial appropriation from their
funds for the purpose of placing some 8000 spies
on the various routes of march between Aix-la-Chapelle
and Saint-Quentin. As a result, the
very quarters of the various regiments of German
invading forces had been marked out for occupation
by the Berlin authorities at least two years
ahead, while for the purposes of lodging important
personages, special hotel managers had been installed
several months before August 1914. In
Brussels as well as in Paris the city had been
so well mapped out that, as American correspondents
reported, distinguished officers arriving
by rail at the Gare du Nord or the Gare de l'Est
gave their instructions as couriers might have
done, without doubt or hesitation, to the cabmen
at the stations. All these preparations had been
made by German fixed agents whose various
residences throughout the line of advance bore the
familiar caricature of "Kluck's cow." As the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
proved in Belgium, such fixed spies had become,
from lengthy and normal residence in the various
cities, so familiar to Belgian inhabitants that
these last supposed them to be either the victims
of the German billeting process, or else compulsory
agents under the terms of martial law. In Paris
matters had been prepared so far in advance
that it had been decided to give a representation
of Sudermann's <cite>Heimath</cite> at the Comédie
Française, at which the Kaiser and his Staff were
to be present. That chronically disappointed
potentate was to reside, the German papers of the
time declared, at the Élysée, the President's abode,
while the procuresses of Paris, mostly Germans,
felt, in view of the commissions already distributed
in advance among them, emphatically
assured that their financial millennium was to arrive
with the German Staff. It had even been arranged,
by way of a spectacular <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revanche</i>, that the
so-called War Lord was to visit the Invalides,
where Napoleon's body reposes, and there possess
himself of the great soldier's sword, as the
Corsican had, in 1806, possessed himself of the
sword of Frederick the Great, saying as he took
it, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ceci est à moi</span>"—this is mine. The military
set-back was in all probability the least which
the Emperor William suffered by his failure to
"hit" Paris as a Westerner might put it, seeing
that the Kaiser can hardly be called a military
man in any practical sense of the term.</p>

<p>In regard to the fixed spies in Belgium, it has
to be noted that they were not all, as far as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
known, natives. Competent Belgian journalists
declared at the outbreak of the present war that,
at the defeat of France in the war of 1870,
Germany had already laid down plans for eventually
overrunning and annexing both Belgium and
Holland. With a view to carrying out her plans,
she made in 1872 definite appropriations for the
covering of both countries with a system of what
was known at Berlin as "Germanising influences."
It was based on a principle of giving to deserving
minor tradesmen in the Rhineland districts sums
of money sufficient to set them up in business in
the so-called Belgian "penetration area." Preference
was given to couples with young children
who had been born on German soil. The people
of the Rhineland and Westphalia are for the most
part Catholics; large numbers of them speak
both French and Flemish, or at least "Plat-Deutsch,"
while from a mental point of view, there
is very little difference between them and the
populations of Liège and Limburg. Once settled
on Belgian soil, it was easy for them to adapt
themselves to the people and bring up their
children as Belgians. It was part of the agreement,
however, that the children, after attaining
a certain age, should return to the Fatherland,
there to undergo a process of re-Germanisation,
at the close of which, having resided with close
relatives and passed through German schools, they
returned to Belgium ostensibly pro-Germans. In
the meantime their parents were being helped to
enrich themselves by acting as commission-agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
for large industrial houses on the German side. It
was supposed that this scheme—an invention of
Bismarck—would prove the key to the conquest
of the Netherlands, for the plans were also put
into operation in Holland. As a matter of fact,
the results of the scheme were far from coming
up to expectations, and if any proof were wanting
to demonstrate the elemental incapacity of the
German for assimilating another race, here it was.
The Belgian and the Dutchman both proved their
capacity (and at the same time their racial superiority)
for assimilating the Germans to the point
at which the latter became anti-German—even as
is the case with the German-Americans of to-day,
who are Americans first and Germans last of all.
By the mid-nineties it was hoped that a large
nucleus of Germanophile Belgians and Dutch
would be preparing for the easy (and perhaps
peaceful) conquest of the Low Countries. Bismarck
had realised, however, by 1890 that "the
German is not by nature or disposition a good
coloniser," whatever virtues he may possess as a
colonist, and for that reason was opposed to his
new Kaiser's ambition to push the frontiers of the
Fatherland farther than they had already gone.
At all events, the organised system of the Germanising
influences proved, to a large extent, a failure
in the Low Countries. It is precisely because it
had not proved so to the whole extent that
Belgium fell so easy a victim to the German
aggressive advance, once Liège had fallen, in 1914.
For as a result of the system of 1872 and onward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>it was hard for Belgians themselves to know
who was in 1914 an agent for Germany and who
was not. In this connection, and as the analogy
holds in some degree, it may be stated that the
main objection to the Oxford Scholarships founded
by the late Mr Rhodes was based on an argument
advanced by observant German professors who
had seen Britain's system at work—namely, that
the German citizen was too easily assimilable
by stronger and superior types to allow of his
passing three or four years at the intellectual hub
of the British Empire without detriment to his
German patriotism.</p>

<p>While discussing Belgium we are reminded of
the fact that at the University of Louvain many
theological students from Germany were in
residence before the war and were, therefore,
enabled to keep their correspondents in Germany
in touch with matters of importance as to the
feeling of Belgian professors and the Belgian
hierarchy generally towards Germany and German
aspirations in Belgium. It is not so commonly
known, however, that every German army includes
in its ranks a number of renegade priests, or
priests in minor orders, who are sufficiently well
acquainted with religious matters to be able to
impose upon villagers, or local parish priests and
nuns. The non-Catholic forces which arrived
at Louvain in September 1914, when they came
into conflict with the Catholic Bavarian troops,
were entirely to blame for the mutilation of
the historic city, since reprisals on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the inhabitants—if any serious reprisals ever took
place—were said by American and Australian correspondents
to have probably been due to the
fact that many of these ex-priests had been given
clerical attire from the military clothing department
and sent to visit the local religious houses,
not as soldiers, but in their clerical capacity. The
result was a series of outrages both at convents
and colleges, the recital of which has already been
officially given to the world by Belgian authorities.
Stieber placed much reliance on this peculiar
class of spy in the Austrian campaign of 1866 and
again in that of 1870. The German authorities
continue to employ them and they are ever
willing to serve, since as a rule they belong to a
class whose poverty and rakishness are known
throughout Germany. They are not, it may be
said, confined to any particular religion, and in
the present war their functions have been exercised
mainly in ministering to the wounded, from
whom they are successful enough in extracting
information as to the movements of opposing
forces. Readers do not require to be told at this
juncture of the unscrupulous use which German
armies have made of the Red Cross ambulances
in the war of 1914. Not only have they clothed
the most notorious creatures of German towns in
nuns' attire, but in many cases youthful soldiers
have been dressed as Red Cross Sisters and have
thus been enabled to pass through the enemy's
lines, ostensibly on errands of mercy, but in reality
in order to spy out the situation. That German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
commanders have little regard for the lives of their
men is better known, perhaps, than a common
ruse to which they resort when looking for artillery
range. At nightfall two recruits are invariably
asked to volunteer for duty with the wire-coil.
They advance towards the enemy's lines which
they are instructed to inspect, paying out the
coil of wire as they advance. Naturally they are
shot as they approach the other camp; their
officer's object has, however, been accomplished,
and when his end of the coil ceases to "pay out"
he is in possession of the range.</p>

<p>The present war, experts assure us, has not
developed anything new in the way of cipher
messages, and it is now generally admitted that
man has yet to devise a cipher which, given time
to solve its principle, will continue long to remain
a puzzle to inquiring minds. Napoleon adopted
a cipher with which he communicated on many
occasions with his chief-of-staff, Berthier, whose
only recorded witticism is that the Emperor's
handwriting was the hardest cipher he knew.
By Napoleon's directions, a certain pamphlet
was to be employed according to the day of the
week or the date. The names of these were of
course known beforehand. The instructions ran:
"The first figure will give the number of the
page; the second figure will give the line; the
third number will serve as index to the required
word, or letter, and give its position in the line
indicated by the second figure; if the figure
denotes a whole word, it will explain itself; if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
only means a letter the fact will be shown." The
whole system was found, however, to be too slow
for the most impatient of commanders, and as a
result was rarely called for by the Emperor. The
Great War has disclosed the fact that old Indian
tricks of conveying information over long distances
have been resorted to, particularly the Red Man's
signals by smoke which ascends at various points
along a given line and the different readings of
which are settled by agreement in advance among
those sending and receiving the signals. It is
now known that information as to "range,"
which, at the opening of the war, German
artillerists were able to discover with a rapidity
and a precision which were not less than miraculous,
was being transmitted to the enemy by fixed
spies in towns behind the French and British
positions by means of smoking fires built upon
upland territory according to indications previously
agreed upon and based mainly on the number and
arrangement of the different volumes of smoke.
The ruse was quickly penetrated however, and
thereafter German gunners proved less expert
in judging distances. We also heard much at
the beginning of the war, both on the Continent
and in England, of the "window-light" and the
"window-blind" system of communicating intelligence
to the enemy on land as well as on the
coastline. All these tricks have been discovered,
and as a result of the most stringent exercise of
precautions, as well as the insistence upon
martial-law regulations at nightfall in the fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
areas, military spies have been forced to rely more
largely on personal adventure and its risks, than
was the case in the earlier phases of the conflict.
Spies sent in advance of an army, disguised as
peasants of the countryside, can keep their friends
informed of the movements of the enemy by
various signals also drawn from the Red Man's
code, such as the breaking of trees or branches,
cutting up squares of turf and disposing them in a
certain order near trees, by chalk-marks not very
dissimilar to the "marks" used by English and
American tramps or by the placing of stones at
certain distances—all signs which can be read
according to previous arrangement. In regard
to these ruses it may confidently be said that
modern man is far behind primitive or uncivilised
man in the effective employment of them,
and, in any case, there were few of those now
recently in use which were not commonly practised
by Napoleon and his commanders.</p>

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>The man who now occupies the chair at the headquarters
of the Berlin Secret Police is called
Steinhauer. For the past two decades he has
been one of the most important officials connected
with the bureau and was responsible for the
commissions given to Turr, Windell, Graves,
Lody, Ernst and a host of experts, the majority
of whom have engaged in espionage both in
France and England and unfortunately remained
uncaptured. Steinhauer's contribution to the
German system of spying has been connected
mainly with the adoption to its ends of modern
scientific inventions. At the outbreak of the
War of 1914, for instance, it is certain that in
Paris alone, his agents were manipulating a
round dozen of wireless apparatus concealed,
in several cases, on the roofs of hotels which
were, of course, under German management, and
in other cases in private houses, as well as on
private yachts on the coasts of France. Much
of Steinhauer's money has also passed into the
hands of British manufacturers of automobiles
and makers of British military uniforms who
were, all unconsciously, selling their goods to the
Berlin sleuth's emissaries in Britain and France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to be used for the purposes of espionage in time
of war. A writer in the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Petit Parisien</cite> has stated
that the Berlin military authorities possess uniforms
of all grades capable of clothing an army
corps composed of all the different types of soldiers
in Europe, while their batteries of foreign-made
automobiles can only be numbered in terms of
hundreds. Steinhauer is a firm believer in the arts
of "demoralising" by scares the non-combatant
population of an enemy country. Those notorious
but substantial rumours, which occasionally
ran through England, of Zeppelin raids upon
Newcastle and Colchester, and which were subsequently
proved to be groundless, all emanated
from servants of the chief of the Berlin Secret
Police operating in Britain. The French writer,
Elme Caro, has drawn the attention of his countrymen
to this form of espionage in the following
words:—</p>

<p>"There is above all one especial ruse in which
our enemy excels, and that is in spreading false
reports and rumours. We are forced to believe
that this characteristic must have its roots deep
down in the traditions of Germans and the
institutions of their race, since it called forth
the especial indignation of Immanuel Kant.
Their methods of applying treachery and bad
faith to the arts of war are peculiarly a Prussian
talent and one which in the war of 1870 cost us
more than one bloody defeat. What is the
process? We are given just that particular
brand of news which is likely to please us and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lull us into a fancied security, such news being,
if necessary, invented for the purpose. These
experts in the arts of deceit and trickery are past-masters
in demoralising the enemy by conveying
to him news which suggests the idea that peace
is close at hand. During such lulls, one's courage
begins to weaken, the soul of a great city begins
to find itself growing unaccustomed to the idea
of war, our firm resolutions are soon forgotten
and we go back to the old routine of life with
relieved minds and hearts. Our will-power is
broken and the enemy then seizes his opportunity
to attack us with many chances in his favour.
To prevent us from getting good news, to convey
to us the worst, to invent it if necessary—this is
the policy of the leaders of German armies and
diplomacy. Bismarck possessed all this talent
and carried it out with the prescience of a master
in the art of judging and estimating the weaknesses
of common human kind."</p>

<p>Steinhauer was also responsible for the rumours
of 1909 and 1910 in regard to the alleged nocturnal
visits of aircraft to the east coast of England, and
his henchmen in the Press go so far as to declare
that in 1911 a Zeppelin visited the London area
on more than one occasion for the purpose of
"taking time-distances," so that in the day of
war any given airship would know by the time
schedule where to drop its bombs, in such a way
as to destroy buildings which had been previously
marked out for attack. By this method, it is
said, a Zeppelin can act independently of fog, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
indeed, would be enabled to carry out its work
more effectively because of fog, provided it was
favoured by fair winds—a view supported by
Mr Graves, who also maintains that Zeppelins
have already in peace-time "stood over" London.
"A mysterious sky-monster," says Graves, "which
carried a complement of five-and-twenty men
and twelve tons of explosives, sailed across the
North Sea, circled over London and returned to
Germany. This new dreadnought of Germany's
flying navy was aloft ninety-six hours and
maintained a speed of thirty-eight miles an hour
in the face of a storm-pressure of almost eighty-three
metres." The German Press, in November
1914, declared that its airship fleet was three
times as large as that which already existed in
1910, and through its confidential writers in the
Dutch papers, it asserted that the German
General Staff had produced Zeppelins which
were "75 per cent. more air-worthy and safe"
than the passenger-Zeppelins which travelled
over Germany in 1909—all of which claims are
purely "scare-work" of the Steinhauer bureau,
for obviously enough, Berlin's military authorities
would long ago have acted against Paris and
London had they been able to do so, time being
such a tremendous factor in their campaign.
We pass over the cases of Schultz and Ernst as
being still fresh in public memory to take up that
of Lieutenant Turr, one of the most important
spies who has operated in Europe since Steinhauer
has been connected with the Berlin Secret Police.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
In regard to the man Ernst, the Islington hairdresser,
who received at first £1, and subsequently
£1, 10s. a month from Berlin, it is certain that the
Berlin authorities showed themselves, in modern
times, as inept in their naval and military espionage,
as they proved to be in their diplomacy,
for all the information they obtained through the
instrumentality of their North London barber collaborant.
Indeed, at this writing, it is rumoured
that Dr Steinhauer has been disrated in his
Berlin office and is about to take the road into
retirement with many more of the Kaiser's
incompetent servants.</p>

<p>Hermann Turr was a subaltern in a regiment
of the Prussian Hussars who, owing to perversity
of character and disposition, was removed by the
Kaiser's orders from the Army List about ten
years ago. At the suggestion of the then head
of the Prussian Secret Service, who urged the
man's bad character as a point in favour of his
being employed as a spy, Turr was given employment
by the secret police in Berlin, his first duty
being the watching of other spies in the same
department—an employment, it may be said,
which is only given to a man whose social and
financial condition is in the desperate stage. It
was in respect of what we will call the "Sans
Souci" correspondence—it was really nameless—that
Turr came into prominence, not only in
Germany, but in every country in the world.
The "Sans Souci" correspondence was published,
without name or title, in Germany and contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
accusations of the most serious kind laid to the
account of the Hohenzollern family as well as to
that of the highest official and court personages
of Berlin. The present Emperor, suspecting a
member of his entourage whom he had been forced
to exile, called in the services of Turr, promising
him a large sum for proofs as to the identity of
the author of the letters. These appeared in
1905 in pamphlet form and were immediately
suppressed, severe penalties being threatened,
as in the equally notorious "Hotzé" letters of a
previous generation, to all who should be proved
to have sold them. Turr proved his zeal within
a month of receiving his commission by giving
alleged proofs that the letters had been written
at the instigation of a well-known French politician
whose Germanophobia is only exceeded by his
remarkable talents in diplomacy. It is certain
that about this time, 1906, Germany was on the
verge of declaring war against France, and it
was only when full proofs were forthcoming that
Turr's "evidence" was based mainly on forgeries,
that Franco-German diplomacy weathered the
storm which threatened its relations. Turr, it
is understood, was imprisoned, but secured his
release on a personal appeal to the Emperor,
promising to reveal the real authorship of the
forgeries in question. In accordance with his
story, the forged evidence had really been
handed to him in Paris by persons acting in the
interests of the Berlin war-party which was already
anxious for a trial of strength with France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which chose this means as likely to precipitate
events, Turr being really the dupe of their agents
who were acting in conjunction with the Berlin
Secret Police in order to force the Emperor's
hand. Another man who also served the bureau
over which Steinhauer now presides was Windell,
who once tended the French General de Boisdeffre
as valet in Paris and was taken by that officer
all through France on his tours of inspection of
the military districts and fortresses, Windell, an
educated man and a trained engineer, supplying
Berlin with plans and memoranda of all and
everything which might serve the interests of
the General Staff.</p>

<p>In a large measure also to Steinhauer must be
attributed the rigorous methods which govern the
production of the modern first-class German spy.
A full possession of those personal gifts which
characterise the man of the world is insisted upon
by the authorities at "Number Seventy, Berlin,"
as the headquarters in Kœnigergratzerstrasse in
that capital are invariably known to employees.
A candidate for service is not only expected to
"look the part," as they say, he is also expected
to be able to act it. He is therefore required to
be a man who has had the advantage of good
home training of a really superior class, one who
possesses social breeding besides decent scholarship,
a combination which is less common in
Germany than in either France or England.
Apart, however, from the mere matter of scholarship
and address, the rule holds here as in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
other business of life, that it is after all character
which really counts. A man is looked for,
indeed, very much similar, as to his mental
capacities, to the really high-class newspaper
correspondent of our own day—one who is at
home in all capitals, who can talk intelligently
and intelligibly on current topics and has a good
repertoire of languages at his tongue's disposal,
who is unquestionably master of his own language
and who can associate with men placed above his
own condition without displaying the servility of
the flunkey, or the assurance of the man whose
loudness is invariably the measure of his own
uncertainty of his social worth and standing.
As far as Prussia produces men of presentability,
the Berlin bureau has always succeeded in enlisting
excellent agents for its purposes, and, in any
case, we have seen that it generally looks for
them among decadent members of the territorial
families, or among officers who have made false
steps in the course of their careers, but who are
still sufficiently attached to life to be content
to serve under the double flag of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
d'espionnage</i>, despised by all who pretend to
imposing standards of honour, yet certain of a
good living if they perform their duties. The
number and scope of the studies to which they
have to devote themselves, once they are entered
on the books of the bureau, will surprise men
who recall the years they spent in lecture-rooms
studying for army or higher civil-service examinations.
Indeed, it is only a well-educated man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
possessed of really an advanced kind of knowledge
who is competent to engage in the curriculum
which goes to form the German spy of our own
time. The average Sandhurst or Woolwich cadet
on "passing out" would only just about hold
his own with the men who "coach" in Espionage
for the examination set by Dr Steinhauer and his
board of professors.</p>

<p>Once accepted as a member of the Secret Service
of the higher grade, the agent is entered on the
pay-sheet at a fixed salary commencing at £200
a year, with an added ten shillings a day for
personal expenses whether on active service or
not. For each "job"—neatly executed, to be
sure—he is promised a bonus with an increase of
personal out-of-pocket allowance up to £2 daily.
He is notified, however, that 33 per cent. of all
moneys coming to him will be kept back and
banked for him at 5 per cent., the object of
this measure being to assure the Service a hold
upon its agents in case they should be inclined
to leave without giving due notice. The salaries
are paid monthly in advance. Personal instructions
are given verbally to each accepted agent,
on his initiation: he must report daily when
not on active service at Number Seventy; should
he be on active service, he must telegraph a
certain number to indicate that he is alive and
accessible; he must observe absolute silence in
respect of his missions, nor converse even with
high officials under whom he is not acting; he
shall carry no memoranda and no documents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
but must trust to memory; he is to avoid fellow-agents,
is forbidden to drink, or associate with
women; he must never sign his name, but always
his number; he is provided with a separate cipher
which he must always use for cabling and telegraphing.
It is only at this point, however, that
the real "grind" begins for your German Secret
Service agent, who, whatever may be his moral
shortcomings, is certainly worthy of all respect
when considered in regard to his mentality.</p>

<p>His studies of a technical character may be
said to be confined to Topography, Trigonometry,
Naval Construction, Military Fortification and
Drawing. His tutors are invariably taken from
the ablest experts in their subjects. Supposing
a Secret Service be sent to Antwerp to study the
forts and report upon them, he must be in a
position to give correct estimates of heights,
angles, distances, ground-lay; he must, therefore,
be a surveyor the accuracy of whose intuitions
must to a large extent cover the work of the
theodolite or the transit-compass. In the case
of the spy, for instance, who reported to Berlin
upon the Forth Bridge, the work had to be
performed without arousing the attention or
the suspicions of officials; the man in question
effected his measurements by pacing, by observing
angles and by subsequent triangulation, the
result being highly creditable to his training, for
he judged the required measurements to within
yards and feet in distances and heights, respectively.
It may be objected that this was wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
time, since these facts are available to anyone.
The General Staff at Berlin was taking no
chances, however. Its object in sending its man
to examine the Forth Bridge was solely to find
out how many men could be so disposed, in the
vicinity of the structure, as to blow it up at a
given signal, what was the geological nature of
the foundation-shafts, how much dynamite would
be required to destroy the bridge. And Berlin
wanted to <em>know</em>.</p>

<p>So too with regard to all matters military
and naval, as we shall presently show. There
is, indeed, no time for leisure and no laggards
are allowed to remain very long upon the roster
of the General Staff's Secret Service College.
Anything more complete or thorough, it would be
hard to imagine, and but for the sinister aims
and objects of the whole curriculum, it would
be difficult to picture anything more admirable
or workmanlike in its organic perfection. The
work entitled <cite>Secrets of the German War
Office</cite> written by Mr Graves has, as most people
are by this time aware, been disavowed by the
Berlin authorities as being the work of what
Americans call "a good guesser." This, it must
be seen, was the only course open to the German
Staff, and their disclaimers in no way discount the
value of their ex-agent's story when he touches
upon purely departmental and organic details
connected with the Steinhauer bureau. He tells
us himself that he served for twelve years in the
German Secret Service which has three distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
branches—that of the Army, that of the Navy
and the Personal Corps. The General Staff of
Berlin controls the Secret Service departments
dealing with both military and naval affairs,
while the Personal department is directed from
the Foreign Office and is really under the direct
eye and touch of the German Emperor himself.
The military and naval sections deal with the
procuring of hidden and secret information in
regard to armaments, plans, new inventions and
codes. The Personal Corps concerns itself with
diplomatic affairs, details as to cabinet discussions,
royal and princely scandals and includes among
its agents men and women who are conducting
inquiries on behalf of the Emperor himself.
Among its members are to be found princes,
dukes, counts and barons, lawyers, clergymen,
doctors, actors and actresses, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaines</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</i>,
journalists, authors, money-lenders,
jockeys, trainers, waiters and porters. Mr Graves
dismisses the waiters and the porters as being
nonentities who are never given commissions
except those of the most non-committal kind, and
in any case are never entrusted with the reasons
underlying the little jobs which they perform
at a few shillings each time. After a successful
series of missions, men in the higher departments
receive salaries from the bureau varying between
£600 and £2000 yearly, which sums are invariably
supplemented by generous bonuses—£1500
is not uncommon—as a reward for good work in
particularly perilous enterprises. The remuneration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>is, however, mean when compared with the
dangers undergone, and since no official countenance
is ever given (nor, indeed, expected) on the
part of an agent's employers, once a spy falls
into the hands of the enemy, the game is far
from being worth the worry and strain it entails.
Moreover, a time comes in the case of the very
successful agent when he has learned so much
about the "policies" of his highly placed patrons
that his existence becomes a source of anxiety
to them, and his removal is often effected by
means which recall the time of the Borgias or the
days of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oubliette</i>.</p>

<h2><abbr title="15">XV</abbr><br />

<small>GERMAN SECRET SERVICE—<i>concluded</i></small></h2>


<p>We have emphasised the German Spy System
to the extent of devoting five chapters to an
exposition of its methods and the principles underlying
its origin, development and application.
Our object has been mainly to show not only to
what extent a nation may become demoralised
by allowing a system of espionage to assume
the proportions of a constitutional principle,
but more especially to indicate how ineffective its
operations must ultimately prove when opposed,
not necessarily by counter-espionage, but by the
ordinary legal safeguards which foreign governments
can at all times put into force to neutralise
such operations. At the outbreak of the War,
for instance, the British authorities were able,
by the simple process of internment and registration,
to destroy in these islands the bulk of effective
German influences on which Berlin had long
relied for the consummation of its insane dream
of "making Britain a German province." Again,
the comparative ease with which eleventh-hour
systems of counter-espionage have proved themselves
capable of defeating the elaborate and far-flung
organisations of fifty years of German
master-spies must have the result of teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Germany that a military establishment which
puts its first trust in its external spy systems
as providing the royal road to warlike successes,
really admits its own lack of military genius. Indeed,
it is impossible to read the story of Stieber's
exploits and not realise that Stieber, rather than
von Moltke, won those strategic successes of 1866
and 1870 which laid the foundations of the modern
German Empire. And just as Bismarck has had
no successor in the business of German diplomacy,
so is it certain that Stieber's mantle has fallen
upon no modern exponent of German espionage
capable of adding to the original system. We
have heard much of the triumphs of the Berlin
Secret Service; the results of the War must
disclose its total failure, though we may even
now confidently predict that the blunders of its
present directors have not been less glaring than
those of Berlin diplomats. Like everything
systematised in Germany, its organisation of
espionage was systematised to the point at which
independent and original action became impossible,
so that when faced with conditions which
Stieber had not known and provided for, it at
once revealed its impotence and ineptitude, as well
as the incapacity of its organisers for attaining
practical results.</p>

<p>We propose in this present chapter, which
concludes our account of Germany's system, to
show how complete is the training of agents for
the work of military and naval espionage. The
German military spy, it must be premised, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
rarely an officer on the active or retired list, but
almost always a civilian who has, of course, had
military training. Turr and Windell had both
been military officers who had practically been
cashiered, while Lody had been a minor officer
in the German merchant service. The German
military agent must know all units of foreign
armies at sight and must also be able to memorise
the code words by which such units are indicated
in the Berlin bureau. In respect of code words,
indeed, his memory must, in all military matters,
be of a Napoleonic capacity, and when corresponding
with his head office as to the work of any
particular pattern of gun on which he is instructed
to report, it will go badly with him if he fails to
quote his code accurately. Since, by the regulations,
he is not permitted to carry documents,
his task is obviously not an easy one. And so,
again, with classes of explosives and types of
shell. Furthermore, he must be so intimate with
the science of fortification as to be competent to
produce a map of any required fortified place,
its maximum content and capacity for resistance.
No Woolwich cadet of two years' standing is
expected to know half as much as your German
military spy, while his periodical examinations
are conducted on a scale which would be sufficient
to make studious officers of the Staff College
doubtful as to their ability to "floor" the papers.
Any error transmitted in the way of information
as to guns, man-capacity of fortresses, new ideas
in strategy and tactics, ballistics, plans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
military maps, are dealt with in Berlin on the
American plan—that is to say, the offender is
never given a chance to offend twice. Nor is
the art of generalisation, so common in journalism,
ever permitted to pass muster at Number Seventy.
Particularisation is insisted upon, for Berlin wants
facts first, last, always and everywhere. To
ensure complete accuracy, the General Staff will
employ, if necessary, a dozen spies on the same
mission; they operate unknown to each other,
their reports are compared and discrepancies
mean the sending out of supplementary agents
on the same mission, until by a process of exhaustion,
and perhaps after several years of
observation, the mathematical truth is finally
arrived at. In the meantime, perhaps, the
structure of any given fortress has been radically
or partly altered; still the process goes on, for
Berlin's General Staff never sleeps, is eternally
vigilant and alert and possesses the only financial
stocking in the Empire which knows no end. All
this is in accordance with a rule laid down by the
Bismarck-Stieber combination—namely, that the
German Intelligence Staff shall know as much
about any country in Europe as that country's
own Intelligence Department could possibly know.
In Austria in 1866 and in France in 1870, events
proved that it knew far more. In whatever other
way a high-class German secret-service man may
fail to please the critics, there can be no question as
to the degree of sheer intellectual ability required
to enable him to reach his position—and retain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to Naval espionage, the course of
study and the mental discipline exacted are, if
anything, more severe. Fundamentally, of course,
the system differs but little from that just dealt
with, just as the winning of a battle involves the
employment of strategy and tactics which are
not fundamentally different from those employed
in the taking of a fortress, as Napoleon said.
The majority of accepted secret-service agents
on entering upon their studies in Berlin,
Kiel or Wilhelmshafen, rarely know enough
about naval matters to be able to distinguish
a torpedo from a torpedo-boat destroyer. After
a course with the instructors the agent not only
distinguishes easily between the large variety of
types of torpedoes, submarines, mines, he can also
tell by the peculiar whistle it makes whether a
torpedo when being discharged is a Whitehead or
a Brennan, as the case may be. Then his work
in naval dockyards and on coastal defences has
practically no limit. Naval construction he must
be as fully versed in as the best informed of naval
commanders. All sorts of naval war-craft are
set before him for the purposes of study, and the
candidate for advancement is required, before he
passes out with a certificate, to be able to tell
at a glance, and from their silhouettes, all known
war-craft in existence, big and little. After
months of study, a quick learner will be able to
say at once the type of any given war-vessel
shown him and what its nationality. Add to
this a perfectly accurate acquaintance with flag-signals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>and codes, the different ranking officers
of <em>all</em> the navies of the world, the personnel of
warships of the heavier classes, the various
uniforms, the ability to talk about any or all
parts of a gun, a torpedo, a tube, a mine, whether
assembled or unassembled, and it will be freely
admitted that the German naval spy must be a
ready man in the fullest sense of Bacon's term.
And yet on another page we have said that
German espionage is a doomed failure. We still
maintain it, and for the reason that the foregoing
studies only result, after all is said, in naval
theory. As a maker of theories, your German
of all kinds and conditions, is the first man in the
world; it is when he comes to their practical
application that he fails so badly and disappoints
his admirers so painfully. The end of German
naval espionage is of course the invasion and
conquest of Britain, and until German armies
defeat us and our Allies on land and her Navy
has beaten us at sea, we may feel justified in
holding that both her military and naval systems
of espionage are respectively not worth the rentals
paid for their dingy offices in Berlin. There is
a hoary old tale told about an Englishman, a
Frenchman, a German and a certain wonderful
crocodile which once made its appearance in
Orinico waters and made the nations talk about
him. The Englishman decided to start at once
for Brazil and hunt the creature out; the Frenchman
decided on general principles to carve him
out in stone, just as he imagined the new animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to be; but the German went to a zoological
museum, <em>thought out</em> the new crocodile from a
set of palæozoic bones, and wrote a theory about
him. Your German theorist is still far from
having passed away and hardly yet realises that
there is a large difference between learning the
secrets of our naval forces and defeating them
at sea. We recognise that German espionage is
a danger—a fact which need not, however, blind
us to the certainty that Germany has no more
Bismarcks or Stiebers to build up new organisations
with which to face the conditions of a new
world. Germany has certainly no minister in
office to-day who could prophesy so far ahead
the course of events as Bismarck prophesied them
to an Austrian lady, the Countess Hohenthal, in
1866. We recall the anecdote:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Count," said the Austrian to the
famous Chancellor at a dinner-party in Berlin.
"I have two homes in Europe, one in Bohemia,
the other at Knautheim, near Leipsic. My
countrymen are all talking about the possibility
of Prussia invading us in the near future, and you
might set my mind at rest if you would advise
me where to remain for the rest of the year—in
Bohemia, or in Saxony?"</p>

<p>"Countess," replied the Chancellor, "if I were
you, I should remain in Saxony. It is not on
a military route." The lady's Bohemian Castle
was not, as it happened, very far from—Sadowa.</p>

<p>As to the financial aspects of the German Spy
System, it is a matter of public record that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Reichstag makes a yearly appropriation of about
£1,000,000 sterling for the purposes and objects
of the Imperial Secret Service. It is obvious,
however, that the total expenditure must be far
in excess of this sum, since, to use a memorable
phrase, "every dirty little lieutenant" who has
taken a holiday within the past ten years and has
consented to spend his time in England, has done
so at the expense of the Secret Service of Berlin.
In these cases the young officers are "invited"
to inspect the counties through which they travel,
and in order to facilitate their movements, they
are each supplied with sectional maps which are
more perfect in every particular than the cyclists'
hand-books with which we are so familiar in these
days. There is no lane, bridle-path, road, farmhouse,
pot-house, or farrier's which is not clearly
marked in these sectional maps. The prospective
tourist—who is most frequently a minor departmental
official—is handed one or more of them
on the understanding that if he can improve upon
their topographical value in the smallest particulars,
he will benefit to the extent of a hundred
marks or so. The result is that official Berlin
knows England north, south, east and west, far
better than any Englishman knows Berlin, and
one may depend upon it that if an army corps
were to land anywhere in Britain, its commanders
would know the road to London, as well as local
facilities and capacities for feeding 40,000 men,
far better than the majority of Irishmen know
the way to Tipperary or even the civic standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of that much-sung city. The gathering of such
minute information involves a costly process.
One million sterling yearly must be inadequate
to cover the expenditure of 500 registered and
salaried officials, with "details" numbering at
least 500 more of a more or less fixed status,
and twice that number of annual tourist candidates
looking for German bank-notes.</p>

<p>Before concluding our examination of the
German Spy System, we may hear what an
American war-correspondent has to say in regard
to the precautions which the General Staff takes
in order to preclude the operations of spies inside
the German lines. The following incident was
communicated to <cite>The New York Times</cite> by its
special correspondent on 1st December 1914:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"GERMAN GREAT HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Dec. 1.—There is a certain monotony
about the scientific murder of the firing line—a
routine repetition of artillery duels, alarums,
and excursions which can be and are being vividly
described by 'war correspondents' from the
safe vantage ground of comfortable cafés miles
away. The real human interest end of this ultra-modern
war is to be gleaned from rambling around
the operating zone in a thoroughly irresponsible
American manner, trusting in Providence and
the red American eagle sealed on your emergency
passport and a letter from Charles Lesimple,
the genial Consul at Cologne, to keep you from
being shot.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<p>"For instance, you get some interesting first-hand
knowledge as to how spies can 'get away
with it' in spite of the perfect German military
system of controls and passes. There is no 'spy
hysteria' in Germany but none the less the
German authorities know perfectly well that there
are swarms of spies in their midst and are hunting
them down with quiet, typically Teutonic thoroughness.
But the very perfection of the German
military machine is its weak spot, and on this,
my second visit to the German Great Headquarters,
I was able to give the astonished
authorities a personal demonstration as to how
any smooth-tongued stranger could turn up at
even this 'holy of holies.' The nocturnal trail
led in a military train from Luxemberg over
Longwy to Longuyon.</p>

<p>"From here I started out on a foot tour,
and entered the Grosses Hauptquartier (Great
Headquarters) unchallenged, by the back door.
Journalistically it was disappointing at first,
for it was Sunday morning and apparently
Prussian militarism keeps the Sabbath holy.
There was no one interviewing the Kaiser, for
he had gone 'way down East' and with him
his war minister, <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> von Kalkenhayn. The
courteous commandant, <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> von Hahnke, was
not on the job. Even the brilliant chief of the
press division, Major Nikolai, was out of town
when I called on the Great General Staff. But
there were compensations, for at a turn of the
road I saw a more impressive sight than even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>motoring Kaiser—a mile of German cavalry
coming down the straight chausse, gray horsemen
as far as the eye could see and more constantly
coming over the brow of the distant hill, with
batteries of field artillery sandwiched between.</p>

<p>"On the next day I again dropped in on the great
General Staff and found it not only at home, but
very much interested on discovering that I had
no pass to come or go or be there at that time.
The war-time mind of Prussian militarism is keen
and right to the point. It saw not the chance of
getting publicity in America, but the certainty
that other more dangerous spies could come
through the same way. By all the rules of the
war game, Prussian militarism would have been
thoroughly justified in treating me as a common
spy in possession of vital military secrets, but it
courteously contented itself in insisting on plucking
out the heart of the journalistic mystery.
All attempts at evasion and humour were vain—here
was the ruthless reality of war. It was the
mailed Prussian Eagle against the bluff American
bird of the same species, and the unequal contest
was soon ended when Major Nikolai, Chief of
Division <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> of the great General Staff, stood up
very straight and dignified and said:</p>

<p>"'I am a German officer. What German
violated his duty? I ask you as a man of honour
how was it possible for you to come here?'</p>

<p>"The answer was quite simple: 'The German
military machine was so perfect that it covered
every contingency except the most obvious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>guarded every road except the easiest way. All
you have to do is to take a passenger train to
Luxemberg, and hang around the platform until
the next military train pulls out for Belgium or
France, hop aboard, and keep on going. In case
of doubt utter the magic phrase, "I am an American,"
and flash the open sesame, the red seal of
the United States of America—to which bearded
Landsturm guards pay the tribute of regarding
it as equally authoritative as the purple Prussian
eagle stamped on a military pass.'</p>

<p>"Followed a two-hour dialogue in the private
office of the chief of the Kaiser's secret field
police, as a result of which future historians will
find in the Kaiser's secret archives the following
unique document, couched in Berlin legal terminology
and signed and subscribed to by the
<cite>Times</cite> correspondent:</p>


<p>"'Secret Field Police, Great Headquarters,
Dec. 1, 1914.</p>

<p>"'There appears the American war correspondent
and at the particular request of the authorities,
explains:</p>

<p>"'On Saturday, Nov. 30, I arrived at Trier on a
second-class ticket at about 10.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> There I
bought a third-class ticket and boarded a train
leaving Luxemberg at about 12.15 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> I did
not go into the railroad station, but trusting to
my paper, boarded a military train leaving at
12.45 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, going over Longwy to Longuyon,
where I arrived at 3.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, Sunday. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>an official whose name I do not know took me
to a troop train and made a place for me in the
brake box. I left the train at X and went on
foot to H (the Great Headquarters), where I
reported myself to the Chief of Police.</p>

<p>"'I recommend that a sharper control be
exercised on the station platform at Luxemberg
as it is a simple matter to avoid the only control
which is at the ticket gate, by simply not going
out and therefore not having to come in.'"</p></div>

<h2><abbr title="16">XVI</abbr><br />

<small>DIPLOMATIC, SOCIAL, CHURCH SPIES</small></h2>


<p>The so-called mystery of the notorious Chevalier
d'Eon has long since been proved to have been
no mystery at all. The question of his sex was,
during his whole life, a matter of fierce dispute
and much speculation in many countries. At
his death in London, in the year 1810, an English
doctor, Courthorpe by name, gave full attestation
to the fact that the deceased Chevalier was neither
a female nor an hermaphrodite, but a complete
man. D'Eon, it is hardly to be disputed, must
rank among the great diplomatic spies whom the
world has produced and even in his own age,
when the mystery attaching to his person made
him an object of extraordinary social interest,
all men were willing to bear testimony to his
courage, physical energy, industry, audacity and
wit. In all probability no one was ever made
the confidant of his reasons for adopting female
dress, but in every likelihood there was nothing
more romantic in his peculiarity than the mania
for being conspicuous and attracting attention,
unless indeed, as has been suggested, he chose to
wear woman's dress for the reason that it was
more comfortable than that of man and had the
advantage of making him appear taller than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
really was. About the Chevalier it is known
for a certainty that one Douglas, a Scottish
diplomatic agent, when proceeding to Russia
in 1755, on a mission to the Empress Elizabeth,
in the interests of Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV.</abbr>, took the clever youth
with him—at the suggestion of d'Eon himself—dressed
him as a female and introduced him to the
Court of Russia, where his knowledge of languages
soon obtained for him a post as reader
to the Empress, over whom for a short season he
obtained an ascendancy which enabled him to
turn her sympathies towards an alliance with
France. Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV.</abbr>, as we remember, had never
possessed any real political or diplomatic power
within his own realm, and in order to offset his
official impotence, thought out his famous private
organisation of court and political intrigue-mongers,
which eventually became known as
"The King's Secret." Douglas was among the
men employed in this body, the Prince de Conti,
Duc de Broglie and many other nobles, both
French and foreign, also assisting the King in the
conduct of a conspiracy the real object of which is
not very apparent, if it was not for the pure love
of the mystery and intrigue surrounding the whole
business.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_fp_256"></a>
<img src="images/i_fp_256.jpg" width="400" height="509" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center smcap">The Chevalier d'Eon</p>

<p class="center"><i>After a painting by Angelica Kauffmann</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Practical results were, however, achieved in
the case of d'Eon. According to the Duc de
Broglie, Douglas had proved himself an unacceptable
person at the Russian Court and it
was only through the employment of the services
of the youthful Chevalier, then about eight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>twenty years old, that he was enabled to attain
his mission's object. Far from resenting the
trick, when d'Eon, on asking to be released from
his position in order to return to France, at the
same time revealing the real nature of his sex,
the Empress Elizabeth was delighted at the
manœuvre and made her reader a handsome
present on his departure. He was described
about this time as highly educated and capable
of writing with distinction on literary subjects;
very much devoted to the study of law and philosophy,
but, one is somewhat uneasy to hear, as
indifferent to female beauty as was Frederick
the Great. It is in 1759 that he is to be found
working for Louis as a spy upon the official
French envoys. In that year the Duc de Choiseul
was sent to Russia with the object of inducing the
Empress Elizabeth to mediate for peace in the
Seven Years' War. The Chevalier was at the same
time deputed to go to Russia, where his earlier
exploits had given him favourable notice, and
bring about the failure of Choiseul's mission.
Accordingly d'Eon became possessed of an important
French secret which Louis was not disposed
to have revealed to his contemporaries;
he was given at the successful issue of his mission,
a sum equal to £1200 yearly of our money and
was sent to the army of the Upper Rhine as aide-de-camp
to Marshal de Broglie, where the King
hoped a bullet might remove him. The Chevalier
appears, however, to have exhibited prowess as a
soldier, and in 1762 we find him secretary to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
French Embassy in London, where he was instrumental
in rifling the portfolio of an important
English Foreign Office attaché by resorting to the
somewhat vulgar expedient of giving the diplomat
too much to drink, the inference being that the
wine was drugged. His success must have been
important, for in 1763 he was resident Minister
in London. In this capacity he began to organise
a scheme on behalf of Louis for the invasion of
England, and as Horace Walpole states, the
importance both of his rôle and position began
to prove too great for his usually cool intelligence.
As a result of a few sharp repartees to French
visitors of rank whom he suspected of spying
upon him, as in truth they were, the Chevalier
soon found himself reduced to the rank of Secretary,
the King, indeed, ordering his man to return to
France, but not to present himself at Court.
In what followed the intelligent observer begins
to discern glimpses of that so-called "artistic
temperament" with which we have become so
familiar in these later days. D'Eon declared
that Louis, far from wishing for his removal
in an official capacity, had instructed him to
resume female attire and keep up the game of
espionage in England. The late Mr Andrew
Lang declares his belief in the probability that
Louis, realising that the little Chevalier's possession
of so many important secrets made him a dangerous
enemy, actually wrote the letter in question,
fully aware how far the "artistic temperament"
was likely to carry the disappointed minister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
D'Eon indeed threatened to reveal so much to
English statesmen that Louis deemed it better to
compound with a pension equal to several thousands
yearly and permission to correspond with
himself. Up till the death of the King in 1774
the Chevalier indulged his old taste for espionage
in the intrigues which sought to restore the
Stuarts to the English throne. The new Government,
probably with the prescience of unrest
to come which should require the financial aid
of England, sought to buy the Chevalier off,
offering him a large sum in return for the documents
regarding the projected invasion of England,
an alleged condition of the contract being the
extraordinary clause that d'Eon should return to
France and continue during the rest of his life
to wear woman's clothes. It was hoped by this
means to deceive the public with the story that
d'Eon was a lunatic woman if he ever should
give way to his well-known petulance. At all
events the Chevalier returned to France where,
to the disgust of the connoisseurs, the lady
showed signs too evident of the use of the razor,
was as muscular as an athlete, wore high heels,
but spoke like a musketeer, had her hair cut to
the scalp and used to do the hall-room staircase
at the unladylike rate of four steps to the jump.
D'Eon soon lost his popularity in Paris and even
his public offer "to become a nun" failed to
tickle the quidnuncs. He returned to London,
where he died, a faded old dowager-looking scarecrow
with a very red nose, in 1810.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>And, of course, there was another very clever
diplomatic spy who flourished in the same age,
a member of the famous de Launay family, who
was known all over Europe as the Comte
d'Antraigues. He was a singular example of the
man who was determined at all costs to play a
part in the tortuous diplomacies of his time and,
paradoxically speaking, it must be said that
although his life proved a failure he achieved an
historical success which has endured. We confess
to a liking for a phrase which his biographer
Pingaud has written in his regard: "His life is
interesting like that of all men who have kept up
the fight, have always been beaten, but have never
admitted their defeat." A man whom Napoleon
condescended to notice must have been not only
interesting but important. The Emperor characterised
him as a "blackguard" and "a walking
impertinence"—the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insolent</i> meaning
here perhaps our term an officious busybody,
which the Count undoubtedly was. Louis <abbr title="the eighteenth">XVIII.</abbr>
called him "the fine flower of sharpers"; for
Spain he was a "charlatan"; Austria christened
him "a downright rascal," and Russia characterised
him as one of the vilest men in the
universe. Nevertheless, Napoleon tried once to
buy his services, the Bourbon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emigrés</i> paid him
to keep their cause before the eyes of reactionary
Europe, while Austria, Russia and the Court of
Naples always listened to his advice and suggestions.
We have shown in another chapter that
Antraigues was mentioned as the person who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
procured first-hand information of the secret
clauses of the Treaty of Tilsit, and it is certain
that French and Russian writers for the greater
part declare the Count to have been the betrayer
of both France and Russia. There can be no
question that he became known to Canning, the
Foreign Minister of the day, as a man whose
"inside information," to use the American phrase,
made him a magnificent ally; but it is also
certain that by the year 1807 Antraigues had
become discredited both in Russian and French
diplomatic circles and, in any case, was hardly
in a position to exercise much personal or practical
influence in so momentous a conference as
that which took place upon the historic Raft.
The accepted English view is that the secret
clauses came to the knowledge of Canning through
an oversight on the part of Alexander who had
allowed the Russian Minister in London to learn
more than was expedient.</p>

<p>There is no better exemplar among all the
exponents of espionage in its higher phases than
the Comte d'Antraigues in so far as he provides
us with positive proof that there comes a point
at which a spy, already too dangerous by reason
of his private knowledge, must be placed beyond
all possibility of indiscretions. The Count was
murdered in 1812 by an Italian valet who was
afterwards declared by enemies of d'Antraigues
to have been in the employ of the foreign secret
service, a somewhat easy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-post-facto</i> explanation
on the part of individuals who had long wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the Count on the safer side of Styx. The fact
that his wife was murdered at the same time lends,
however, some colour to the statement that the
murder had been "fixed" as they say in the
vernacular of the Black Hand. She had been in
her time a famous opera singer who had tried to
found a political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> on the basis of the private
information which her husband possessed, and
altogether seems to have been one of those
terrible but inept females who wander through
the world for the unrest of souls, not only knowing,
but knowing that they know. We make
no apology for insisting that the fact that
d'Antraigues was of Gascon birth is a point in
favour of our idea that megalomania is in a large
measure the motive-power which turns men and
women to the business of espionage. The native
of Gascony is by every tradition, both home and
foreign, said to represent Pretence made flesh.</p>

<p>It is very certain that the number of secrets
which pass out of the cabinets of diplomacy into
the possession of non-diplomatic persons must be infinitesimal,
and it is also certain that the Machiavellian
waiters on whose long ears depend the
fate of thrones; or the inspired courtesans who
wheedle men like Bismarck out of information
the divulging of which is sufficient to shake the
hemispheres; or the journalistic sleuth who
divines a cabinet débâcle from the way the Foreign
Secretary gives an expression of opinion to the
War Minister about the fineness of the night as
both leave Downing Street; or the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Ambassador to Everywhere who visits Constantinople
and "draws up a treaty" which he submits
to an uncle of the Sultan's head doorkeeper as a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> for the Balkans—all of them are
the fictitious creations of very "yellow" writers.
These beings really count for less in the processes
of diplomacy than the proverbial row of pins, and
only the most credulous of souls can accept such
a story as that which professes to show how so
important a personage as a Russian Ambassador
was once taken off his guard to the extent of giving
away a secret the publication of which to the world
led to an estrangement between France and
his own country, the medium of his lapse being
a Polish Countess with a form like Juno Victrix,
eyes as big as billiard-balls, the soul of one of
those awful Ouida heroines who felt it in her to
"dominate the world with the man I love," and
the manners and attitudes of a vaudeville high-kicker.
Important information which has ever
"transpired" from an embassy or a ministry for
foreign affairs has done so in ninety-nine cases out
of one hundred by sheer accident; in the unique
case has it been given by agents from within and
then most certainly not to a courtesan, but to a
practical man of business by an equally practical
man of business, money being in each case the
first consideration. The diplomatic espionage of
reality is quite a different matter from that of
fiction and in all probability Napoleon was its
best exponent, with his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet noir</i> for the supervision
of suspect letters; his couriers who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
always on the road, ostensibly carrying dispatches,
but in reality in quest of special information;
his sisters who through their ladies of honour spied
upon each other's movements; and his secretaries
who controlled the organisation of private spies
who spied upon the spies set by Talleyrand and
his department.</p>

<p>Prussia, as everywhere else, leads the way in
internal diplomatic espionage and there is not a
court of kingly or princely rank in the German
Confederation which can boast that its most
intimate actions, scandals, expressions of opinion
and intentions are safe from the scrutiny of the
authorities at Potsdam. Indeed, it is safe to say
that Potsdam has long had its especial agents
watching and reporting in every Court of Europe,
and the comparatively recent "Posen" case shows
to what length the vile system of Prussian
espionage is prepared to go in order that Potsdam
shall be kept informed. Some years ago the Berlin
authorities were anxious to know what was the
real state of feeling towards Germany in Prussian
Poland, and accordingly a well-known Prussian
Guardsman was sent to Posen with instructions
to seduce the somewhat flighty and "modern"
daughter of a Polish notable who was said to
stand high in the Polish liberation movement.
It was not quite certain, however; but as Berlin
saw the approach of the war of 1914, it was necessary
to know soon how the exact situation lay.
The young Guardsman effected all that was required
of him, also discovered how matters stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in regard to the Polish movement and then returned
to Berlin. This fact was one of the many
which came to light in the course of the Harden
trial of 1907, when it was clearly proved that the
Emperor William had his own private <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
d'espionnage</i>, even as Napoleon and Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV.</abbr>
had had theirs. This body attended to diplomatic
as well as social matters, and in her Memoirs
the Princess Louise of Saxony shows that no
society is too exalted nor any too low for the
operations of its sleuths who, as in Stieber's
hey-day, have driven men from public life to
satisfy the private hates of persons only too
willing to purchase their services.</p>

<p>Social espionage is too well known the world
over, to call for very much attention. It is one
big trade in information of one kind or another,
in return for which the giver expects to receive
special consideration, or achieve some end. The
anonymous letter fiend who transmits real or
pretended information about another person to
a third party, the lady's maid who is in the
service of other women besides her mistress, the
private secretary to a politician, or banker, or commercial
man, who accepts "presents" from his
master's rival, the tattling flunkey, the money-lender's
tout, the race-course and training-stable
"lumberer," the copper's "nark," the parish
gossip who "tells things" to the Vicar, the little
'tweeny maid "wot's got eyes in her 'ead" and
all these—there is no nation on earth, nor any
little hamlet that does not know them, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
would be idle to speculate as to whether they are
less known in England or America than in any
other country. It is sufficient to know that they
exist and that they carry on a trade in special
information either for money or its equivalent.
In Paris they are more numerous than in London,
while in Berlin, at the great houses in the official
quarter, it is a certainty that nearly all the men
and women employees are paid to spy upon their
employers by outside influences of various kinds—official,
military, social, commercial and clerical, and
when the people of Berlin are not spying on those
above or below their own classes, they fall back
upon spying among themselves, as a writer named
von der Goltz remarked more than fifty years ago.</p>

<p>The famous Tausch bureau of private espionage,
of which we heard so much during the Harden
trial in 1907, and which was founded by Baron
Tausch for the purposes of spying, just as a private
individual in Britain, or America, or France, might
found a news agency—this bureau had its analogy
once in London on a minor scale, and was conducted,
very privately to be sure, by a deceased
peer bearing a title of ancient degree which is
now owned by a youth whose relationship to
"Old Inquisition" (as he was once called by a
society paper) must necessarily have been very
remote. Nevertheless, and for fear of hurting
anyone's susceptibilities, we propose to speak of
the defunct noble as Lord Pinkerton. It was not
necessary to be in Society to recognise this peer
whose business was as well known to London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
residents as his face—aquiline as to the nose and
eye, somewhat furtive in his movements, generally
silent, but always observant and mysterious. He
flourished in the late mid-Victorian days when
nearly every man and woman in important Society
was able to show as many quarterings of nobility
as are required for membership among the Knights
of Malta, or as formerly were essential to every
candidate for inclusion in White's Club. Accordingly,
he was an elderly man in the eighties and
early nineties when golden keys began to open the
doors of the most sacrosanct circles. One does
not require to be very old to remember the great
social transition that took place between, say,
1887 and 1902, when the first-fruits of the Education
Act of 1870, together with the results of
Colonial enterprise had combined to create a
new class of social climber, which altogether upset
previously existing conditions and, indeed, finally
ended by flooding them out. In former generations
wealth had, of course, always found a way
in; but it was wealth with some added virtue and
by no means that which expressed itself in mere
display and extravagance such as arrived in the
mid-eighties with adventurers of all types and
kinds in the hunt for social distinctions and
honours. By the nature of things, the exclusive
peer found he was fighting elemental forces, and
as a consequence he was far from proving the
regenerator of Society that he hoped to be. It is
certain, however, that his private correspondents
kept him well informed, for it was well known that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
by 1890 he had been successful in hunting down
many individuals, mostly foreigners, whose claim
to social recognition had not only not even the
merit of being backed by great wealth or good
birth, but whose early careers had been stained
by crimes of the darkest kind and who had made
their appearance in London society under assumed
titles and names which were either fictitious, or
to the ownership of which they had no claim whatever.
Some of these men had made their early
debut by successful operations on that dead-leveller
the Turf, had been elected to fashionable
racing-clubs and had passed by an easy transition
into important social cliques which were patronised
by the first leaders of English society. Nor was
there any doubt about it that the detective-peer
had the courage of his chosen mission, for once
in possession of facts sufficient to provide him
with a sure case, it was his practice to call immediately
upon the social masquerader offering him
the choice of either retiring from Society quietly
and unobtrusively, or else of running the gauntlet
of a campaign of ostracism which should
effectually force his disappearance both from the
Turf and English Society. The victim invariably
made a brave show of indignation and outraged
innocence, only, however, to submit when unequivocal
evidence of his past was presented to
him in full.</p>

<p>Pinkerton was instrumental in removing from
both Turf and Society a foreigner of Teutonic
origin who was known in his meteoric career as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
"the Prince." He had, it was found out after
his demise, begun life as a waiter in Vienna, and
possessing a famous gift of tongues as well as an
unusual talent for self-education, passed successively
to Berlin, Paris and London; here as a
private secretary he entered the employment of
a wealthy Englishman of profuse and eccentric
habits. It was related of our "Prince," as
middle-aged racing-men can tell to-day, that he
obtained his first start in life by backing the Derby
winner Sainfoin in 1890. To effect this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> he
had extracted from his employer's private desk
eight bank-notes each of the value of £1000.
Arriving somewhat late at Epsom, he handed the
whole amount over to the bookmaker so well
known in those days as "Chippie" Norton, who
laid the market odds—at least 5 to 1 against.
Sainfoin won the race, beating both Le Nord and
Surefoot and "the Prince" requested Norton, as
a favour, to let him have his bank-notes back,
the balance, some £32,000, to be paid in the
ordinary way. On the same evening the lucky
winner replaced the notes, and on the following
Monday received his bookmaker's cheque, told
his employer the story of his good fortune, receiving
from his patron introductions which gave
him at once a social footing among racing men.
The man's personality was admittedly a fascinating
one and he quickly made his way among
some of the best-known coteries in London. It
may be remembered of him that, being Austrian,
not long from Vienna, he professed as an eye-witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>to have the true story of the tragedy of
Meyerling which closed the lives of the Archduke
Rudolf and Marie Vetsera. In a day when
all London had the "correct version," with its
attendant mysteries and political intrigues, the
story of our "Prince" differed from others by
reason of its simplicity. The Archduke (he used
to tell), when deeply flown with wine, insulted the
Baroness in presence of other guests. The lady
left the room, returned with a revolver and shot
her lover dead, turning the weapon on herself in
a frenzy of remorse.</p>

<p>The adventurer's season of prosperity was not
long and by the end of 1890 he had lost the bigger
portion of what the late Mr Dick Dunn used to
call his "Sanfoinery." He recovered, however,
over the Lincoln which was won by a horse called
Lord George and also followed Colonel North's
famous luck with much advantage to himself.
At the close of 1891 it was rumoured that "the
Prince" was about to marry into a family whose
standing was high in Scotland. It was about this
time, however, that Pinkerton began to make
inquiries and the result was in every way detrimental
to the "Prince's" plans for domestication.
He was soon on the run and in 1893 was
found trying to beat the Pari Mutuel at Longchamps,
when the exclusion of bookmakers from
the enclosures put a term to his turf activities.
This man was by no means the most important
of Lord Pinkerton's victims, for the vigilant
peer's system of espionage was influential enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to close the doors of society to men whose wealth
and influence in Africa was second only to that of
Rhodes himself, but who failed to come up to our
peer's ideas of what was morally fitting for the
great London world of those days. Pinkerton's
self-appointed rôle was not looked upon at all
times with favour by the more liberal-minded
members of what Thackeray calls the Best English
People and, indeed, when one considers the
origin of some of the so-called noble families of
England, Ireland and Scotland, we think the social
purist carried his apostolate just a little too far.
Suicide was, in at least one case, the end of
a victim whose social ostracism Pinkerton had
brought about, and when several of his victims
conspired to bring about a situation that
publicly showed up the noble regenerator in a
character which was at the very least embarrassing,
and as a result of which much mud continued
to adhere after the disposal of the case in a
magistrate's court, very few people were found to
sympathise with the only social spy whom our
peerage has probably ever produced.</p>

<p>We have elsewhere touched upon ecclesiastical
espionage which, we may presume, is not confined
to any particular Church. Its operations in
certain bodies may be said from earliest times to
have assumed the importance of an institutional
principle. In view of our expression of opinion
that espionage is a necessary condition of any
essentially autocratic polity, we are only consistent
in supposing that any Church which requires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>from its adherents a total submission of the
Will to its arbitrary authority can only maintain
its semblance of doctrinal and disciplinary freedom
by the most guileful arts and methods; and it
is not necessary to enunciate the doctrine of
Private Judgment to show that intellectual or
political liberty can flourish only where its principles
fully prevail. It is easy, but altogether
supererogatory, for the once great religious congregations
to disclaim—now that they are shorn
of the secular and political influence which was
undoubtedly theirs in the darker ages—all possession
of secret systems by which they once so
effectively kept men's minds under their sway.
It is only necessary to read the story of the Inquisition
in Venice, in Spain, in Portugal, to learn
how these Church-ruled communities fared under
the iron tutelage of their congregational overlords.
There is to be found, indeed, a strong
analogy between the demoralised soul of modern
spy-ridden Prussia and that of Spain in the days
of the Inquisition, when, under the pretence of
winning men to salvation, crimes were committed
in the name of the Cross beside which the
short but horrific annals of modern Hunnism
stand spectral and anæmic in their comparative
bloodlessness. Napoleon was, as usual, correct
in his view that men who sought the refuge of
the cloister were of a kind who neither wanted
the world, nor were wanted by the world; it was
unfortunate, however, that the wish and will to
segregate oneself from secular activities, far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
killing those characteristics of intrigue which we
associate with the business of worldly life, had the
effect merely of emphasising them in the chosen
narrower sphere and, by a natural reaction, of
turning their currents to baser uses and abuses
than would have been possible in the larger freedom
of the world. We speak, of course, of the
Dark Ages.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to go into the question
of ecclesiastical espionage; but inasmuch as the
Inquisition's operations in Europe were based
mainly, in respect of its bloody triumphs, on the
work of a vast network of espionage which assured
to the Inquisitors their periodical supply of victims
it is only fair, without taking sides, that the story
should be told. Our authority for the following
account of espionage as it was used by the Inquisition—the
name itself suggests its spying character—is
Joseph Lavallée, a French Catholic, who
has dealt authoritatively with the whole subject
of the Inquisition. Lavallée writes in effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Inquisition was at Rome known as the
Holy Office, all the members of which were nominated
by the Pope. They were bound to do his
bidding without question; they were removable
at his pleasure and he could recall them
without any formality, or even without letting
them know the cause of their disgrace. We
need no longer wonder, therefore, at the intrigues
and crimes to which these men had recourse in
order to preserve their places. The business of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>the Roman Inquisition was to examine the books,
the opinions, the doctrines, the public and
private conduct of those who were brought before
its tribunals; in virtue of their office they were
bound to make a report of all their proceedings,
and it was almost always upon their statements
that the cardinals formed their judgments and
decrees. The number of subordinate officers
was immense and these mainly constituted the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espionnage</i> proper, forming the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i>,
or Brotherhood, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruciata</i>, or Crusade.
When any particular crime was necessary in order
to "establish" a case, no matter how revolting
or iniquitous or sacrilegious, the Office could
always find among its spies men and women
both competent and willing to execute its orders.
Whatever crime they might commit, the secular
power had no authority over them; they were
amenable only to the Inquisition, and it is not
to be wondered at if the very dross and scum
of human kind eagerly sought out the work of
espionage as being most congenial. In Spain
and Portugal, the Holy Office was known as the
Inquisition. Its bands of informers were mostly
drawn from the most unmanageable pupils of
the schools; they were sent into the world at
maturity, ostensibly to earn a living, but in
reality to carry out the work of the Inquisition
in the capacity of spies, as the historian Infessura
tells us. The supreme council of the Inquisition
was composed of the Grand Inquisitor and five
members, one of them a Dominican necessarily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The number of "familiars," or spies, surpasses
belief and was in the proportion of one to every
family in Madrid and Valladolid of that period.
As in Italy, they were placed above the ordinary
civil courts and were amenable only to the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>In order to qualify as an Inquisitor, or to
hold any office in the Inquisition, it was necessary
for the candidate to be descended, and to be able
to prove his descent, from a line of "perfect
Christians." Having given this proof, he was
obliged to take an oath of secrecy and fidelity
to the Inquisition, the violation of which was
punishable with death. The body of informers
were bound by the same oaths, and if it was
necessary to procure the "removal" of any person
or persons, these men were employed as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents
provocateurs</i>, death being the alternative if ever
they disclosed the methods of their Christlike
patrons and employers. As we have seen, both
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruciata</i> were the Inquisition's
agents throughout the Peninsula, and
were employed mostly for the purposes of watching
and seizing victims. The smallest hamlets
swarmed with these vermin and they were mainly
drawn by the Inquisitors from the worst characters
in the country. They themselves were
often victims of the Inquisition, whose influence
had destroyed all kinds of secular industry in order
that the Church should profit by it, and members
of both brotherhoods served for the lowest wage
the system which had robbed them of all chance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>of procuring an honourable livelihood. In order
to possess the better claim upon their patrons,
they had devoted all the faculties of mind and
heart to perfecting the arts of espionage, and
no system has ever produced more crafty, more
ruthless, more persevering servants. When once
their attention was fixed upon a victim, it was
but of small importance that he was innocent,
for his doom was settled from that moment. If
his reputation, his rank, his riches did not allow
of his immediate seizure, then recourse was had
to stratagem. All means, however vile or base,
were allowed; they employed all arts, they
assumed all characters, they made use of every
dress, they adopted every possible method of
circumventing and capturing their prey. Caresses,
flattery, entertainments, gold, were all employed
in forwarding their designs; months and years
often passed before a victim was entrapped, but
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i> never lost a victim once it had
fixed its eyes upon his belongings. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruciata</i>
was formed with the object of watching over
members of the Catholic body and seeing that
its members performed their religious duties. It
is not difficult to conceive to what a degree
of hypocrisy such an establishment must have
brought a nation, and if "most Catholic Spain"
were Catholic at all in those days, it was rather
from fear of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruciata</i> than from love of God.
So then the Inquisition had two first-class <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps
d'espionnage</i> which formed two active armies,
always on the alert and always moving among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>the masses, through which both their political and
their spiritual ascendancy remained assured.</p>

<p>That few could escape the attentions of these
spies must be evident when we consider that the
Inquisition characterised as Heretics all who
taught, wrote, or spoke against the Church, its
teachings, its hierarchy and priesthood, or even
those who wrote in favour of methods or teachings
belonging to non-Catholic bodies, or who simply
criticised the Church. To be a suspect was
practically to be a man who was already dead.
To have spoken irreverently of holy things, or to
have failed to inform of those who had so spoken,
to have read forbidden books, or to have lodged
or entertained an heretical friend—these were
sufficient to condemn a man, and according to the
principles of the Inquisition, a man was obliged
to inform against his father, his brother, his wife,
his children, under pain of himself being brought
within the notice of the Inquisitors. As it
happened, the larger percentage of men and
women who became its victims were such as
possessed large means which the ecclesiastical
powers desired to possess. Jews, Moslems, non-Catholics
of all sorts were, equally with Catholics,
amenable to the Inquisition for specified "crimes,"
all of which were punishable by death if the
accused were unable to justify themselves.
Public report, secret information, discovery by
means of spies and voluntary accusation were the
four ways employed by the Inquisition, in order
to bring matters under its jurisdiction. Flight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>was impossible in view of the ubiquitous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad</i>,
and the summary seizure of an accused
person and his immediate incarceration constituted
the usual procedure, once the spies
had reported to headquarters. These spies, or
"familiars," as they were called, were invariably
supported by the Inquisitors, even if evidence had
to be fabricated in order to make up a plausible
case. What was the quality of the Justice
dispensed may be gathered from the following
facts: first, the names of witnesses deposing
against the accused were never given to these
last; secondly, witnesses were not obliged to
prove their depositions; thirdly, all and sundry
who cared to volunteer testimony were accepted,
so that men who were notorious for infamy, for
perjury and for the most scandalous vices were
welcomed to bear witness to the "truth"; fourthly,
two hearsay witnesses were equivalent to one ear-witness;
fifthly, the spies were always accounted
the most reliable witnesses, notwithstanding that
they were in the pay of the Inquisition. Finally,
a son might be witness against his father, a
father against his son, a wife against her husband,
a husband against his wife, a domestic against
his master, or a master against his servant—an
inexhaustible source of treachery, revenge and
the worst qualities of the human heart. The
tortures to which the accused were subjected
in order to make them confess to the commission
of crimes of which they were guiltless were
of three kinds. In the first place the victim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>was taken to a vault which lay sometimes as
many as one hundred feet below the surface
of the highway. According to the nature of the
charge, he was put through the torture of dislocation
by being fastened as to his extremities,
with cords, then raised by means of a pulley,
kept some time in suspension and suddenly let
fall to within a foot of the ground. If on repetition
this means was found insufficient to make the
"subject" confess, his Christian tormentors resorted
to the water-trough, laying him on his
back, binding him as to the legs, and having
stopped his nostrils, poured water from a considerable
height in such a way that its weight
fell upon the throat. Occasionally the master
of ceremonies turned off the flow, not, however,
to give the victim relief, but to prevent his death
by suffocation. Perhaps, even then, he refused to
surrender, and in order to cure his obstinacy a
couple of religious smeared his feet with lard or
oil, stretched him on the ground with the soles
exposed to a terrific fire, and after half-an-hour's
subjection to this ordeal invited him to speak.
If he refused, he was put through the torture
once more and then removed to a dungeon where
he invariably found some others in apparently as
bad a plight as his own, who, as soon as he was
brought in, began to curse the Inquisition and all
connected with it. These were nearly always
spies whose evidence constituted subsequently
that on which the unfortunate man was eventually
condemned to death. The executioners of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>the torture-room were as a rule monks clothed in
cassocks of black buckram, with the head and face
concealed under a cowl of the same colour, with
holes for the eyes, nose and mouth. A Prior
was accustomed to supervise the torture, assisted
by a clerk who referred to his spy agents as
occasion required, or summoned them from an
adjoining hall, where most of them wiled the time
away at dice, in order to fortify all accusations
against the victim. Sometimes an innocent man,
in the vain hope of saving his life, confessed his
guilt. He was then accounted a happy repentant
and, by a special favour, was permitted to be
strangled before being cast into the flames.
Those who persisted in their obstinacy were
summarily burned to death.</p></div>

<p>In modern foreign congregational colleges the
divisions of the school take the form of junior
boys, middle grade and seniors, and as communication
of the youths of one grade with those
of any other grade are most strictly forbidden,
mainly on the ground of morality, a considerable
system of espionage is from the outset part of
the institution's plans. In foreign schools the
spies of any particular grade are officially known
by the other boys, just as monitors are known
in ordinary schools. The functions of the foreign
school-spy go, however, very much farther than
those of the monitor, and so busy is he in the
performance of his duties, that espionage enters
into the minds and habits of foreign youths from
their earliest years. When the late Cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Vaughan—a typical Englishman if membership of
a territorial family of half-a-score of generations
counts for anything—was laying plans for the
founding of a Catholic school in England, he
visited many of the principal colleges in France
with the object of obtaining ideas for his proposed
foundation. Everywhere he was depressed
at the absence of individual liberty and the ever-present
prevalence of espionage. Nor was he
consoled very much, on once asking the distinguished
head of such an establishment what
provision was made for training youths in the
proper use of individual freedom, to hear that
the school authorities saw to it that no freedom
whatever was allowed except under the eyes of
the official supervisors. Neither does the system
fail in its application among the members of any
governing confraternity itself in which the lay-brothers
are spied upon by the functionaries in
minor orders, and these in their turn by clerics
in higher orders, the superior exercising espionage
upon the entire community while the sport begins
again in inverse order, and the chief finds out that
his reports dealing with the subordinate end of
the line are fully supplemented by spies who
report with equal completeness on his own end
of the game. Contemplative Orders, as they are
called, are not, it may be said, confined to the
Roman Catholic Church, and we presume monastic
espionage is as prevalent among the non-Catholic
monks as among the Catholic.</p>

<h2><abbr title="17">XVII</abbr><br />

<small>AMERICAN SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>


<p>It is customary for Americans to declare that
they possess no system of espionage in their
country, and as a rule this is true of American
life under normal conditions. Putting aside the
questions of purely detective work and criminal
investigation, and in these spheres of police
activity America is probably served as well as
any other country in the world, we may safely
say that there is too much individual or social
freedom in the United States to warrant the
permanent existence of anything like organised
espionage. Nevertheless, politics plays a rôle
in every state of the Union, the complexity and
strenuousness of which are not known in any
other country in the world, and wherever the
political game is pursued with resoluteness and
vigour, we may depend upon it that all factions
possess what Americans themselves very aptly
describe as "inside information" regarding what
is taking place in other opposing camps; all the
more so, indeed, as success in political campaigns
in America means possession and employment of
a kind of patronage which is invariably expressed
in terms of dollars and cents. Such information
can only come by way of emissaries planted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the midst of political enemies, and there is attached
to every political organisation a selected body
of men who make it their business, for due
consideration, to work in other camps on behalf
of particular factions. This kind of political
espionage is, it may be said, quite as common
in England, or Canada, or Australia, or France,
or Germany as in the United States, for as it has
been said: "So long as there are governments
so long will there be political spies, and so long
as there are attempts being made to overturn
governments by force, so long will political
espionage remain a necessity." As in England,
or Scotland and Ireland, so in America there is
little in the way of systematised espionage, even
among the vast community of German-Americans
who might be supposed to revert to type, as the
Darwinians put it. Over there, as in these
Islands, espionage is only organised for expediency's
sake and according to the exigencies of
any particular scandal, social or commercial,
which may require the intervention of the agent
of stealth and observation.</p>

<p>Yet, how many Americans are themselves aware
that Charles the First sent his agent Randolph
to America in order to report on the condition of
the Colonies which were even then discussing the
question of severing themselves from the British
bond? Louis the Sixteenth also sent Baron de
Kalb to inquire into the revolutionary spirit
which, as a result of the importation of French
encyclopædism, preceded the Declaration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Independence, and upon the Baron's favourable
report, gave the Revolutionaries that aid which
led in the end to their triumph. Of Hale we have
spoken at fuller length, but have yet to tell how
General Washington had his own secret agents
within the British lines, from whom he received
constant intelligence as to what was taking place
in Howe's and Clinton's camp. Major Tallmadge,
whom we have mentioned in the story of André,
was the agent through whom the information
was transmitted. At first it was written in
sympathetic ink, then a new invention and imported
by General Lafayette, which only disclosed
its message when the paper on which it was
written had been dipped in another fluid. Once
the invisible ink was made visible by the application
of the chemical reagent which developed it,
the manuscript appeared as if it had been written
in the ordinary way. Washington was, however,
a particularly cautious man. He suspected that
the British might very well possess this same
sympathetic ink, and conveyed a message to
Tallmadge that the latter's spy "should avoid
making use of the stain (ink) upon a blank sheet
of paper which is the usual way of its coming
to me. This circumstance alone is sufficient to
excite suspicion. A much better way is to write
a letter in the Tory-style with some mixture
of family matters, and between the lines in the
remaining part of the sheet communicate with the
stain the intended intelligence. Such a letter
would pass through the hands of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
unsuspected, and even if the agents should be
unfaithful or negligent, no discovery would be
made to his prejudice, as these people are not
to know what is concealed writing in the letter
and the intelligent part of it would be an evidence
in his favour."</p>

<p>James Rivington, editor and printer of <cite>The
New York Gazette</cite>, was another agent in the
secret service of Washington. By 1781 this man,
realising that the British were unlikely to succeed
in quelling the rebellion, undertook, in the
interests of his own person and property—for earlier
he had sided with the British—to furnish the
American commander-in-chief with important
information. This he conveyed to the general,
written on tissue-paper and bound in the cover
of school books. Although Rivington was thus
aiding the revolutionary Whigs, he kept up his
daily abuse of them in his newspaper, retaining
the confidence and good will of the Tory leaders
and residents. When in the autumn of 1783, the
British evacuated New York, Rivington was, of
course, suffered to remain, while other Tories were
driven away and their estates confiscated. Major
Tallmadge mentions Rivington as "a gentleman
of business, of education and of honour," a somewhat
stilted way of describing the journalist who,
owing to his position, was able to mix with the
loyalist families on a friendly and familiar footing,
the revolutionary authorities paying him at the
rate of £100 a month for services rendered. Soon
after the Declaration of the War of Independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the new government of the United States made
the then considerable appropriation of £6000
annually for the purposes of secret service. This
money continues to this day to be appropriated.
It is drawn by the direction of the President in
such sums as he may require for specific services,
without any voucher being given beyond the certificate
of the Secretary of the Treasury registering
the fact.</p>

<p>In 1812, it is recorded, President Madison communicated
to Congress the commission and correspondence
of John Henry, a British agent, proving
that while the two countries were still at peace
"a secret agent of the British Government was
being employed in certain States in fomenting
disaffection to the constituted authorities of
the nation, and in intrigues with the disaffected
for the purpose of bringing about resistance to the
laws, and eventually, in concert with a British
force, of destroying the Union and forming the
eastern part thereof into a political connexion
with Great Britain." This work of an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agent
provocateur</i> naturally aroused great excitement
throughout the whole of American Society. No
one had really believed that there were persons
in New England capable of any idea of secession,
although British gold, it was well known, had been
heavily subsidising the eastern Press in order to
rouse up civil discord. To no avail, however;
Henry passed, and the disquiet of the period gave
way to a long period of rest and prosperity.</p>

<p>In the Mexican War large sums of money were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
spent on secret service, and in 1849 Congress made
an appropriation of £10,000 for the purposes of
enabling a body of spies to be formed who were
under the personal direction of the President.
After this war the "hire of interpreters, spies
and guides for the army" was included among
the incidental expenses of the Quartermaster's
department, for which an appropriation has since
annually been made by Congress. When the war
for the suppression of the Southern Rebellion
broke out in 1861, large sums were necessarily
expended by the officers of the regular army and
of the volunteers, on account of secret service.
We note one account sent in by General Butler
for the payment of fifty dollars for a hand-organ
and a monkey. This item was disallowed by the
Treasury officers, until it was explained that both
organ and monkey had been bought at Annapolis
to enable a young officer familiar with Italian to
go through the enemy's country to Washington,
disguised as an organ-grinder and notify the
President of the great Northern uprising as well
as of the approach of the Union troops for the
rescue of the capital. There was undoubtedly a
large number of what Frederick of Prussia termed
"double-spies" in the Civil War, and many secret-service
men who carried intelligence to Washington
also carried Union information back to Richmond.</p>

<p>At this momentous period many of those in the
secret service were convicts who had broken out
of jail, and neither side derived much benefit from
their employment. Blackmail, false charges and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
forgery were used by them solely with the purpose
of obtaining money from their victims. Prominent
merchants in New York and Boston were accused
on false documentary evidence of defrauding their
country. Their books and papers were accordingly
seized and their owners paid exorbitant
sums in order to avoid arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
One victim remonstrated with the
President in the following words:—"It is hard
that citizens enjoying a good name who had the
misfortune to come into business relations with
the Government, should be exposed to such a spirit
[espionage]; that they should be dragged from
their homes and hurried to a military prison;
that they should be obliged to undergo a protracted
trial by court-martial, damaging their good name,
destroying their peace, breaking up their business
and subjecting them to untold expense, when at
the slightest touch, the whole case vanishes into
thin air, leaving behind nothing but the incomprehensible
spirit in which it had its origin."
The informers continued, despite all remonstrance,
to enrich themselves at the expense of wealthy
business men in the North, and many spies then
laid the foundations of fortunes which to-day may
be counted in the tens of millions. The military
spies were doing good work, at the same time,
in the South, though it was afterwards admitted
that the secret service of the Confederates was
far more efficient than that of the Union, the
reason being, it was said, that in the service of the
South were scores of intelligent women of position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
who were successful in obtaining at Washington,
New York and elsewhere in the North, correct
information of the plans and intentions of the
Union generals. This was the case in regard to
the battle of Bull Run, when a Mrs Greenhow
obtained from a Northern politician information
as to the advance of the Federal troops. Indeed,
the operations of wealthy women-spies in the
secret service of the South, during the Civil War,
is one of the most curious features of that event.
Nor were they all Southern women; many of
them were Northerners, and at all events every
one of them owed her fortune and position to the
principles for which the Union stood. These
women watched and waited at official doors until
chance or the unguardedness of an employee
allowed them to learn the particular secret intelligence
they were looking for; they stole maps
and plans and most of them had taken lodgings
close by the War Office, to which they were wont
to invite young departmental secretaries to whom
they offered the pleasures of the tea-table and an
enlightened discussion of Federal iniquities. Mr
Perley Poore, writing in the well-known magazine,
<cite>The Chautauquan</cite>, in January 1887, says: "They
smuggled the information which they obtained,
in the linings of honest-looking coats and hid the
army secrets in the mysteries of innocent-looking
bustles; they burned signal lights from garret-windows
and crossed the Potomac below Alexandria
at dead of night and with muffled oars.
At one time the Government had caught and hived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
over a dozen of these busy Confederate bees in
a house at Washington where, in a few days, they
beguiled the young officers charged with guarding
them and carried on their vocations as before."
One of the best known of these creatures was
Belle Boyd, the daughter of a Federal official;
according to report she was sharp-featured, black-eyed,
quick-tongued, of wonderful energy and
spirits, twenty-five and—very free. She wore a
revolver in her belt, rode a mettlesome horse and
easily attracted the attentions and interest of the
younger officers from whom she extracted valuable
information, though what the officers extracted
in return, we are not told. Boyd organised her
own corps of women spies who were very much
of the same type and character, and if not worse
than herself, were apparently no better than they
ought to have been.</p>

<p>Many stories are told of the ease with which
Confederate secret-service men obtained first-class
information from the departments. A young
Englishman, member of a Washington firm of
stationers who executed contract work for the
Government, was once inveigled into giving away
an important piece of military intelligence to a
secret-service sleuth who had shadowed him from
the capital to New York. Both took up lodgings
at the Brevoort House, became acquainted and
spent several evenings together. The Englishman
casually allowed it to be known that he was
on terms of particular intimacy with departmental
officials and his friend suggested on leaving New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
York that they should correspond. A few weeks
later, the Briton received a letter, addressed to
him at Washington, asking if it were true that the
blockaded port of Galveston was to be opened—could
he find out the facts for a certainty from
his official friends. Suspecting nothing, the
stationer inquired at Washington and was duly
informed as to governmental intentions by a
secretary who really knew. He conveyed the
news to his friend and was only reminded of the
occurrence a few days afterwards when he was
arrested and sent under guard to New York.
Here he found that a noted blockade-runner had
been arrested with the Washington letter in his
pocket. The prisoner proved to be his friend of
the Brevoort House who eventually received a
long sentence, the Englishman escaping only
through the intervention of the British Consul.
The stationer received, however, no more favours
from his official friends and lost a certain fortune
through his lack of caution.</p>

<p>At the close of the war many spies who had
worked for both the North and the South made
their appearance at Washington, where most of
them were taken into the services of the war
department, at that time under the direction of
Lafayette Baker in respect of its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espionnage</i>.
When, in the course of time, President Johnson
was impeached by the Republican party, Baker,
a man of great cunning and resource, set about
impressing the public with the value of his services
to the country. He sought to prove that a Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Cobb had given bribes to members of the Cabinet
in order to procure the pardon of ex-Confederates.
The funds employed in the impeachment of
Johnson were contributed by the distillers, and
the secret service of the Treasury Department
conceived and organised the "whisky ring,"
formed of Government officials and distillery
magnates. The whisky taxes were divided and
about one-half was paid into the Treasury, while
the "ring" divided what remained. When the
distillers slackened in their production the officials
urged them to greater activity, the result being
that although the ring included almost every
revenue official in the West, many politicians of
note and well-known personages in Washington,
the fraudulent gains amounted to millions of
dollars and for years even minor participants in
the combine were pocketing some $500 (£100) a
week as their share in the transaction. General
Babcock, one of General Grant's personal staff,
who was considered to be a member of the ring,
was subsequently tried at St Louis, but acquitted,
although public opinion always regarded him as
guilty and made no concealment of its view that
it was only Grant's influence which had procured
him his acquittal. During the presidency of the
victorious Federal commander, the Secret Service
flourished at Washington and was mainly connected
with the wire-pulling activities of politicians
who saw large profits in contracts for municipal
improvements, a form of "political" enterprise
which has also become common in Europe since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Baron Haussmann, of Paris, showed how much
money there is be made in the exploitation of
"civic patriotism," as it is called. Mr Perley
Poore must be quoted in full in order to demonstrate
the method of the Washington ring and its
agents. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among its other operations was the execution
of a plot concocted by General Babcock and
District-Attorney Harrington to blacken the reputation
of Mr Columbus Alexander who had
made himself obnoxious to the ring. A certain
detective one day informed Mr Alexander that
he could obtain and deliver to him the private
account-book of a contractor which would show
the entire rascality going on. These books had
already been delivered by the contractor to District
Attorney Harrington who locked them up in his
safe. The next night two professional burglars
were hired to enter the office, blow open the safe
and carry the books to Mr Alexander's house.
That day Harrington had informed the police
that he feared a burglary was about to be attempted
and the superintendent, with the whole
detective force, was on hand at the appointed hour.
When the burglars had performed their work,
they walked boldly out at the front door of the
District Attorney's office, where they were kindly
received by Harrington and his friend A. B.
Williams. The principal burglar, having pocketed
his fee, bade his confederates good-night and
walked home. His assistant, in pursuance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>agreement, started for Mr Alexander's house,
followed by the detectives and representatives
of the ring. He lost his way unfortunately and
Williams was obliged to direct him. He rang the
bell for fifteen or twenty minutes, but failed to
arouse anybody. He was then arrested by the
detectives and locked up. Subsequently he signed
an affidavit, at the instigation of Harrington,
setting forth that he had been hired by Mr
Alexander to blow open the safe in the District
Attorney's office and bring the contractor's books
to his house.</p>

<p>"The affair was immediately investigated.
Harrington and the secret-service officials involved
themselves in an inextricable mass of perjury,
and then the detective first employed by Harrington
came forward and revealed the whole conspiracy.
The feeling against the scoundrels who
had thus plotted to ruin the character of an upright
and honourable man was very bitter. The masks
were torn from their faces and they stood revealed
in their true colours. The few honest men who
had been deceived by their pretences into defending
their acts repudiated them utterly. This
exposure of the wrong-doings of the Secret Service
led to the refusal of Congress to make any appropriations
for its pay, with the exception of a small
force attached to the Treasury Department.
The old Capitol prison was converted into dwelling-houses
and nearly all the agents were scattered
over the country, many of them becoming connected
with private secret-service organisations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>As a general rule, these fellows are inferior in
intellect and ability, if not in honesty, to the professional
rascals whom they occasionally arrest.
They often lay traps for weak men in crimes designed
for them, and find vulgar employment by
those seeking divorce from matrimonial bonds.
Secret Service is certainly not a necessity in a
Republic in times of peace, and when their
virtues and their weaknesses during the War for
the suppression of the Rebellion are impartially
summed up, it will be difficult to decide whether
those who professedly served the Union were a
blessing or a curse to it."</p></div>

<p>The Customs House of the great City by the
Hudson has its own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'espionnage</i>, the object
of which is to defeat the large number of tourists
returning from summer trips to Europe, who
attempt the next-to-impossible feat of "beating
the Customs" by smuggling heavily excisable
goods. Under the Roosevelt and McKinley regimes,
when high tariffs were the ruling order,
even rich men and women resorted to all manner
of expedients in order to defeat the excisemen
in West Street landing-stages. In the year 1905
matters had come to such a pass that a definitely
organised system of espionage was adopted with
a view to curtailing the operations of wealthy
smugglers who could well have afforded to pay the
heavy duties involved. The services of stewards
and stewardesses on board the liners were not
only requisitioned, both men and women being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
given pass-keys for the purpose of privately inspecting
the luggage of suspected passengers, but
women, apparently of wealth and standing, were
also commissioned to travel to and fro between
European and American ports and use all the
means at their disposal to induce sister American
tourists to give up, confidentially of course, a
correct estimate of their purchases in Paris and
London, the same information being duly transmitted
to the New York Customs as soon as vessels
berthed, or touched at Sandy Hook. Not only
were the maids and valets of suspected smugglers
suborned, but even, in London and Paris, the
counter salesmen connected with fashionable outfitters
and jewellers, as well as invoice clerks, were
paid a fixed rate of reward for all information given
to American Consular agents in Europe which
might help the transatlantic port authorities to
discover the delinquents and their private contraband
on arrival at New York. Then there was
the trick of the weighing-machine, guaranteed
to take avoirdupois to the smallest fractions—plausible
women spies and officious stewards and
stewardesses making it their pleasure to have
each saloon passenger "scaled" in order to show
how beneficially sea-travel affected the health.
At the Customs offices at New York these machines
stood ready, in duplicate, to weigh any fair suspect
who might possibly have swathed her form
in contraband silks or other prohibited commodities,
and a comparison with weight-lists previously
supplied by obliging stewardesses was sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to decide the question as to whether or not she
was to be made the object of a personal visitation
by the official female searchers of the Port. In the
case of one lady who was weighed off Queenstown,
the indicator then recording 10 stone 6 lb.,
or 146 lb., duly registered by a stewardess, it
was found that the duplicate machine at New
York made her turn the scale at 168 lb., the
result being that she was found to be carrying
dutiable goods concealed on her person worth
many hundreds of dollars excise tax to the
authorities.</p>

<p>Much is told of the alleged system of newspaper
spies employed by English and American "yellow"
papers, which are said by the uninitiated to employ
their corps of spy detectives in the same way as
an established secret service employs its special
agents. In America it is quite certain that since
the so-called "yellows" depend to the larger
extent on the providing of purely "police" news
to their clients, a certain amount of espionage
becomes part of the work of the daily reporter.
During the course of the notorious Thaw trial,
in the last decade, witnesses of all sorts—including
the young wife of Thaw—were subjected to the
attentions of reporters who, by following their
social movements, were able to add suggestive
tit-bits to the "stories" appearing daily and
nightly in the papers, and much to the surprise
and annoyance of their victims. As far as we
know, however, nothing of the kind has yet entered
into the processes of British journalism.</p>

<h2><abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr><br />

<small>NAPOLEON, HIS MISTRESS AND—A SPY</small></h2>


<p>The authorities for the following story are these:—<cite>Correspondence
of Napoleon</cite>, vol. v.; <cite>Memoirs
of Bourrienne</cite>, vol. ii.; <cite>Memoirs of Prince Eugene</cite>,
vol. i.; <cite>Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Abrantés</cite>, vol.
iii. Except to very minute students of the
Napoleonic legend, it is not very well known, nor
could the episode be said to rise very much above
the commonplace, were it not for the extraordinary
personality of the central figure around whom
the incidents play. It is simply with a view to
showing the operations of what has been called
"the long arm of British diplomacy" that we tell
the tale of an attempt to put a term to Bonaparte's
ambitions as early as 1798, when the Corsican
had only reached his thirtieth year. It is customary
to say that historic figures, no matter how
great or spectacular their enterprises, are never—or
rarely ever—so magnificent, in the classical
sense, to the eyes of their contemporaries as they
prove afterwards to succeeding generations. It
took the battle of Austerlitz, for example, to force
Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël, to say
nothing of the Bourbon Princes, as well as a host
of public men of note, into a full and final realisation
that in the person of Napoleon an elemental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
force had appeared in Europe whose activities in
the world were not to stop till, to use the great
soldier's own memorable phrase, Nature had
ceased to require him as an instrument of its
designs. And we all know the story of how the
younger Pitt received the intelligence of that
conflict of a December midday: "Roll up the
map of Europe," he is alleged to have said, "it
will not be required these ten years"—which was
prophecy with almost mathematical accuracy, if
we may use such a term. The truth is, however,
that seven years previously, British diplomacy
had already gauged the significance of the new
world-portent, and by 1800 plans were already
laid to fight the coming menace to the principle
of the balance of power. The fact itself holds a
lesson for all who fatuously imagine that the
history of the world is enacted in a series of
accidents and that the business of diplomatic
agents consists in meeting and dealing with these
accidents as they automatically appear. The
work of all great foreign ministers whom the
world has known has, on the contrary, consisted
in providing for contingencies long foreseen and
patiently awaited. What Prussia's unique foreign
expert worthy of that name in the story of its
whole diplomacy—Bismarck—achieved in this
way as preparatory to the campaigns of 1864,
1866 and 1870, British Diplomacy is always and
eternally achieving. To the process of its perennial
vigils and deliberate acts we may apply the
famous remark: "There it is, the great engine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
it never sleeps," and as the custodian of the set
principle that no single Power shall overrule the
rights of other nations, men are beginning at last
to realise what in reality it represents, and that
not only is Great Britain now and for ages invincible
and indestructible, but that in her self-charged
world-rôle of defending the Right there
is that which, if need were, shows the mind of
watchful Providence itself.</p>

<p>When, in 1798, Bonaparte set out for his
Egyptian campaign, there were already in active
existence two redoubtable forces with which his
ambition was destined to become fatefully engaged—namely,
Nelson and British diplomatic
vigilance. Long before his début on the Nile,
British Secret Service had put all its forces in
motion in order to upset his designs against
England's Eastern dominions, and not one of
these designs was unknown to Downing Street.
Egypt then, as now, was in respect of its commercial
activities almost wholly under the domination
of English political and monetary influences,
the result being that from the moment of his
arrival at Cairo, an extraordinary web of espionage
had already been woven round the Corsican. It
is suggestive enough that the means which the
secret agents of London proposed to employ for
the undoing of the young conqueror of Italy were
based mainly on the idea that Napoleon was easily
susceptible to feminine influences. His quasi-public
heart-affairs with Madame Colombier,
Caroline Bressieux, Madame Saint-Huberti, Desirée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Clary and the woman Turreau, in Paris, had misled
the British Cabinet, strangely enough, with the
notion that he could be destroyed through the
agency of ministering angels of the venal variety.
At all events, the system of espionage was conceived
upon Bonaparte's supposed foible and its
direction was undertaken by Sir Sidney Smith—whose
interminable after-dinner tales of his
exploit at St Jean d'Acre were afterwards to
win him the title of "Long Acre"—assisted by
John H. Barnett, a secret-service agent in British
employ.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, it is known, had allowed but very
few women to follow his army to Egypt, among
these few being the wives of some of his principal
generals. One of his inferior officers, a certain
Fourès, just lately married, had, however, transgressed
the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, to
the extent of taking his bride-wife with him to
Egypt dressed as a man-servant. In this disguise
Madame Fourès was successful in reaching the
Nile, where she assumed her regular woman's
attire, took lodgings in Cairo and proceeded to
lead an ordinarily domesticated life with her
husband. It was not long, however, before the
story of the lady's deceit came to the ears of
Bonaparte through Junot, a connoisseur in
feminine attractions, and the youthful General
was moved by curiosity to see the rare bird that
had eluded his vigilance and transgressed his
rigorous orders—all the more so, perhaps, as
Junot declared that this one was a veritable bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of paradise in respect of her personal charms and
other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allèchements</i>. Accordingly, he so arranged
matters that in the course of a review of his army
all the French ladies in Cairo should be present
to witness the manœuvres of the troops. Among
them came the youthful Madame Fourès, whom
Junot pointed out discreetly to his General.
Evidently the latter was satisfied with his cursory
inspection, for he turned to his famous lieutenant,
instructing him to issue invitations to a dinner
on the subsequent day to which certain ladies
were to be invited, including Madame Fourès,
whose husband was, however, not among the invited
guests. Naturally, the Captain felt slighted.
He was well known to be a man of fire-eating disposition—as
John Barnett, who knew him personally,
could fully testify—and his first inclination
was to issue a direct challenge to his superior
officer, Junot, whose propensities, where pretty
women loomed large, were known throughout
the army to be what the late Mr Labouchere
used to term patriarchal. Then, on second reflection,
he urged his wife to refuse the invitation.
Now Madame Fourès was just in the newly
wedded stage of her personal emotions, and every
man of experience is aware that a bride in that
stage is more susceptible to the external symptoms
of the love-passion than at any other time. Indeed,
the lady had already divined from Bonaparte's
ardent glance the state of his feelings
towards her. And although she practically, to
use an Americanism, already "saw her finish,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the truth would seem that she did not much care
where she was to end. At all events, she declined
to obey the Captain, twitting him with jealousy,
and accepted the invitation for herself alone.
It had been prearranged that Bonaparte was
not to be of the invited party, but was to make
his appearance during the course of the dinner,
which arrangement was duly carried out, Bonaparte
being presented to all the guests on his
arrival.</p>

<p>Was it not Wellington who declared that
"Bonaparte was no gentleman"? In any case,
after presentation to Madame Fourès, the young
General took a seat opposite to hers and began
to stare the lady out of countenance, exceedingly
to her embarrassment. Then quickly finishing a
cup of coffee and with a curt word of adieu he
passed from the room. Some moments after,
Junot, whose place was beside that of Madame
Fourès, in turning his chair, upset the lady's
coffee into her lap. Apologising profusely for
his awkwardness, the soldier, assisted by General
Dupuy, sought to remedy the disaster with the
aid of sponges and serviettes, only to find that the
stain began to travel all over the skirt and was,
for that day at least, irremovable. General Dupuy
affected to be on the verge of tears. "Junot,"
said he, "perhaps it would be better to allow
Madame Fourès to arrange her dress in some
adjoining room." And Junot led the Captain's
wife to an adjoining room, in which was—Bonaparte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>At this juncture our mind travels back, anachronistically
enough, perhaps, to the late Artemus
Ward, his "morril bares and wax figgers," and
we feel inclined to ask the honourable printer
to "put sum stars here." We prefer, however,
to fall back on the profound observation of a
French historian who deals with this episode. He
says: "Madame Fourès entered that adjoining
room with a blot upon her dress which was bad
enough. It was nothing, however, to the blot
upon her character when she came out." The
lady was, it appears, wholly complacent, and as
the presence of her husband was now a matter
of embarrassment both to herself and Bonaparte,
the latter took immediate steps to assure the
return of Captain Fourès to France—ostensibly
as the bearer of sealed orders to the Directory.</p>

<p>"My dear Fourès," said Berthier to him in
accordance with this decision, "you are luckier
than the rest of us, for you are going to see France
once more. The Commander-in-Chief has decided
to entrust you with a mission of the highest importance,
knowing as he does your ability and
reliability. Your future lies in your own keeping.
The orders are that you shall leave at once with
dispatches."</p>

<p>Fourès saw his chance at once and took it.
When, however, he declared it his intention to
take his wife, too, Berthier objected. It would
be impossible, urged the famous Chief of the Staff,
to allow Madame Fourès to run the risk of
capture by English naval officers who—Berthier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
emphasised the point—were notorious for their
taste in Frenchwomen. Besides, there was the
discomfort of confinement on board a battleship,
which would give the British officers every excuse
for treating the lady as quite other than a prisoner
of war, whatever they might do with himself.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et puis, ce cochon de Sir Seedny Smeet—ah, Fourès,
mon ami, voyons donc!</i> And so poor Captain
Fourès left Egypt on board the <i>Chasseur</i>, commanded
by Captain Laurens, while Bonaparte
installed Madame Fourès near the palace of
Elfi Bey, where he himself resided, and thereafter
lived with her as openly as he had lived with the
actress Grassini in Milan.</p>

<p>As mischance would have it, the <i>Chasseur</i> was
captured by the British man-o'-war <i>Lion</i>, commanded
by Sir Sidney Smith, under whose orders
John H. Barnett was then serving as secret agent.
On their meeting for the second time, the Englishman
said to Fourès:</p>

<p>"Well, Captain, you must now be edified at
the moral character of the scoundrel whom the
Directory has given you for Commander-in-Chief
in Egypt."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" asked the Frenchman,
with some colour.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, Captain," replied Barnett.
"I understand your heat and will try to cool it.
Listen: as we consider you to be the victim of a
disgraceful intrigue on the part of Bonaparte, we
propose to land you on the Egyptian coast. Once
arrived there, you will rejoin your corps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
regain possession of Madame Fourès, your former
wife."</p>

<p>"Sir," exclaimed the now indignant Frenchman,
"will you be pleased to explain?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Barnett, "is exactly what I
am endeavouring to do, and if you will have the
patience to listen, you may understand."</p>

<p>Thereupon the secret-service man drew from
his pocket several newspaper cuttings which gave
full details of the scandal in which the names of
Madame Fourès and Bonaparte were associated.
The story showed, furthermore, the arrangement
by which Fourès had been induced to carry dispatches
to the Directory, Bonaparte being well
aware at the time he entrusted the Captain with
his mission that only a miracle could enable him
to elude the vigilance of the British cruisers and
pass over to France. Once he became a prisoner
of war, Bonaparte would be assured of the possession
and enjoyment of his new mistress.</p>

<p>The Captain's emotion on hearing of his commander's
treachery and his wife's connivance
in the trick was painful to witness, and the poor
fellow broke down under the ordeal. His papers,
it was proved to him, were of no importance
whatever, and Barnett showed him duplicates
which had been taken of them before the Captain
had even left Cairo.</p>

<p>"When you arrive at headquarters," the relentless
Barnett proceeded, "one of our agents
will conduct you to the palace of Elfi Bey, where
Madame Fourès has lived with Bonaparte since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
December 18, the date of your departure with
the dispatches. As for your fellow-officers, they
all know of the affair and you have become the
object of the army's ridicule throughout Egypt.
As a man of honour you will doubtless know how
to avenge yourself on both culprits. Life is cheap
in Egypt in these days, Captain."</p>

<p>In due course Captain Fourès reached Cairo
and soon realised that Barnett had told him
nothing more than the truth. His wife remained
a willing prisoner with Bonaparte. Accordingly
he prepared for action, meaning to kill his two
betrayers. It was pointed out to him that in
view of the existence of martial law and his failure
to carry the dispatches entrusted to him, the
Commander-in-Chief would be justified in having
him shot; while his friends urged, knowing the
man's character, that, after all, to risk his career
for a worthless woman, in a quarrel with a man
like Bonaparte, was worse than madness. The
Captain determined, however, to see his wife
and obtain an avowal from her own lips as to
the facts of the whole intrigue. According to the
records, Fourès found her, still unrisen, at the
mansion of Elfi Bey, learned from her own
admission that she was satisfied with her present
lot and, without further parley, flogged the
strumpet till she writhed in agonies on her bedroom
floor. Fatality of fatalities, who should
enter and find her in this condition, but Bonaparte
himself. He gazed for one dramatic moment at
the shrieking woman and turned with a raucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
laugh on his heel. Fourès, in due course, procured
his divorce and made, as he himself declared,
"a sacrifice of his resentment against Napoleon
to France and the Army." As it happened, the
luck was, on this occasion, against the British
Secret Service agents. Had Bonaparte fallen a
victim to the jealous rage of Fourès, should we
have had a Trafalgar, an Austerlitz, a Jena,
a Waterloo? There are not wanting those who
maintain that all these historic events were in
the inevitable logic of the French Revolution and
that with a Bonaparte, or without him, they
must in their due turn have come to pass—a
question which is far too large for present discussion.
In any case, it is certain that Bonaparte's
removal in 1799 would have relieved many
European cabinets of much anxiety.</p>

<small>CONCLUSION—BIBLIOGRAPHY</small></h2>


<p>The bibliography connected with the business of
espionage is not, as may be supposed, a very
extensive one. Great spies have all written their
memoirs, but in no case can these works be
regarded as trustworthy records of the actual
parts played by their writers in important
historic events or episodes, and it is always
necessary to go to independent chroniclers in
order to arrive at the truth. As regards themselves,
they are peculiarly fortunate in that
highly placed patrons and collaborators have
rarely, if ever, condescended to criticise or
question their claims or statements, the result
being that their most preposterous pretensions
find acceptance at face value. It is well, too,
that not one of them, as far as the writer has
discovered, evinces anything like literary tact
in his attempts to conceal the essentially underhand
nature of his professional art. Your Schulmeisters
and Stiebers, on the bare evidence of
their own life stories, disclose their real motives
and characters so clearly and intimately as to
leave us with the impression that it is only very
poor judges of human nature who can fail to
categorise them accurately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Our own study of the master spy has left us
unimpressed regarding the qualities of either
head or heart which are called for in the business
of espionage, and whatever courage may appear
to attach to the characters of men like Schulmeister,
Stieber and even André, we remain convinced
that there was in none of them anything
like nobility of purpose and that a very cheap
material ambition underlay all their respective
rôles, dramatic though those rôles may have been.
The characters of the two spies of the War of
Independence seem to us to have been lamentably
lacking in that fine spirituality which one looks
for in men who are willing to die for any strong
faith that is in them; the American appears to
have been an idealist of a type which is not easily
differentiable from the oriental fanatic who is
said to possess no very settled convictions about
his cause; while the Englishman's motives were
based purely upon rapid self-advancement. As
to Le Caron, we admit having approached his
case with every predisposition to admire him,
only to find our earlier illusions entirely shattered
after a careful study of his reminiscences; and
the printed word must be allowed to go a long
way towards self-revelation. As for Schulmeister,
he threw his lot in with the side which paid him
the highest price, and patriotism or nobility of
sentiment in no way coloured his otherwise important
abilities and services, while Stieber—the
odious Stieber was at once a cringing self-seeker,
a bragging bully and, shorn of his protections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
an obvious and elemental coward. MacParlan
was a detective pure and simple, and to him
there attaches no stigma of having taken an
oath to serve a cause which secretly he meant
to betray. Of all the rôles enacted by the
various exponents of espionage with whom we
have dealt, MacParlan's appears to us to have
been far and away the most heroic and, in
view of the dread organisation which he was
fighting single-handed, also the most patriotic
and utilitarian.</p>

<p>In regard to the sources which we have drawn
upon, those which deal with Schulmeister call for
some comment. Napoleon's agent is mentioned
by many of the high functionaries of the Empire
who published memoirs dealing with its glittering
legend. Savary, Fouché, Rapp and Marbot all
give him a word, while Thiers, much later, mentions
him as having contributed a share to the
glories of the Corsican. With the exception of the
short Life by Diffenbach, and his own very unreliable
<cite>Fragments</cite>, we are aware of no exhaustive
biography of the spy, while magazine and newspaper
articles, such as those published in the
<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, the <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Courrier du Bas-Rhin</cite> and
other periodicals, differ altogether as to details
and chronology in descriptions of him. The
author remembers to have read, when a student
in Germany, many years back, an account of
Schulmeister obviously written by an Alsatian
and signed with the name, F. Ott, which gave
particulars as to the spy's first meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Napoleon, as well as the story of his social career
in Vienna before joining the army of Mack.
These particulars are not mentioned by any other
writers except Savary and a scribe in <cite>The Royal
United Service Magazine</cite> of December 1897. In
view of so many conflicting accounts, however,
we have thought it fair to draw upon this recollection
in our own story of the Alsatian,
although at present we cannot recall the exact
source.</p>

<p>Le Caron has, of course, been his own biographer
and the popular Press of the time of the Parnell
Commission teems with accounts, correct or
imaginary, of the Anglo-American major. Sir
Robert Anderson, in his reminiscences, speaks
of his agent in terms of consideration and respect.
In a letter which Sir Robert was so good as to
write to the author, in this connection, appear
the following remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My best agents, when I had charge of secret-service
work, were as much entitled to respect
as were my officers in the Criminal Investigation
Department when I had charge of that branch of
Police work, or as our military who 'spy' the
German trenches from aeroplanes. Others again
take up that sort of work for 'filthy lucre sake,'
and yet others from all sorts of motives, some
praiseworthy and some contemptible. Spies
differ as much as parsons or doctors, and no
general rule can be applied to them. Le Caron
was in every way a worthier and more respectable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>man than were some of the M.P.'s who abused
him in Parliament. Some of my other agents
were much in the same category. Others, again,
who gave me information of great value, were
creatures whom it was an ordeal to have to deal
with."</p></div>

<p>MacParlan's career was well known to many of
the old stagers of the New York and Philadelphia
newspapers, and from one who knew him, the
writer has taken the version he gives of the
admirable detective's final disappearance from
the coal regions of Pennsylvania, according it
preference over the somewhat prosaic departure
as told by MacParlan's excellent biographer,
Mr Dewees. While volumes have been written
to the glorification of Major André, it is unfortunate
that very little is known regarding Nathan
Hale, and it is certain that no portrait remains
extant of that youthful hero. The Duchess of
Portsmouth has been fully dealt with by many
writers; the Chevalier d'Eon has had the advantage
of being portrayed by the late Mr Andrew
Lang, while Pingaud has treated the Count
d'Antraigues. The French Divisional Police Chief
Saint-Just has given to the world an account
of the French Internal Spy System as it exists
in our own day, and Doctor Fitzpatrick is the
chief among many who have written of the
British Secret Service, to the chapter concerning
which we append a Home Office paper, issued
in September 1914, which clearly shows that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
British authorities were by no means uninformed
or unmindful of the contemplated operations of
the swarms of German spies who filled London
hotels and lodging-houses at the opening of the
War. Official alertness, it may also be said, was
shown during the course of the campaign, as
(to cite but one instance) when the Special Police
Constables were mobilised on the night of the
air raid on Sandringham and therearound, a fact
which spoke eloquently for our system of counter-espionage.</p>

<p>With regard to the German System of Espionage,
it must be said that while we do not accept
everything that the arrogant Stieber claims for
his organisation and himself, we are inclined
to look upon Lanoir as being too much a hater
of all things Prussian either to do justice to
himself or to be fair to Stieber. In any case, we
have supplemented the French writer's views by
others emanating from Klembowsky, A. Froment,
Tissot and various publicists well known in France.
The work of Mr Graves we have read, and while
admitting that he wins our sympathy as regards
his perennial good humour and cleverness, we
confess our total inability to "negotiate" (as he
himself would probably say) his version of the
instructions to the <i>Panther</i> at Agadir, the same
having really been conveyed by the very ordinary
process of telegraphing from Berlin to the gunboat's
commander by code to the <i>Fabra</i> news
agency at Madrid, whence the message travelled
to Tangier and Agadir. In the pages of <cite>The New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>York American</cite> Mr Graves's diplomatic work
would certainly prove to be "just the goods,"
if we may judge by the printed European
dispatches of that paper's ineffable correspondents.
All his English countesses and peers have respectively
the airs and manners of Chicago "store-ladies"
and Buffalo drummers—exactly as the
American yellow-paper requires them for home
consumption.</p>
